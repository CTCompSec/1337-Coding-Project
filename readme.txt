This is a simple program that displays 1337 on your github profile under your contribution history.

Currently it starts in July of 2023.  At the time of writing it's May of 2024.  Once we get close to July of 2024, it will stop displaying correctly and I'll need to change the dates.  I could probably write a script that could increment each date by some multiple of 7.

You may want to run the script multiple times

For fun each commit includes a random rap stanza that I snarfed from here:

The overall idea was taken from here:
