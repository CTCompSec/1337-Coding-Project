{"contents":"I'm withholding my anger\nThough I'd like to be the strangler\nOf this punk ass little pussy's puny neck\nIt's my right to insist\nThat he acknowledge my existence\nBut he just displays complete lack of respect\nThat's what he says to himself\nAs he uses his magazines to trash me\nAs he sits with both his feet up at his desk\nSmokes a bag of his weed\nAnd starts imagining things\nAnd he just can't see that he's manically depressed\nAnd in his jealousy and envy\nIt just whirls him in a frenzy\nAs he turns on MTV and sees my face\nHe don't exist in this world\nSo he just twists and he twirls\nSpirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage\nAnd it's destroying him slowly\n'Cause he does not even know me\nEven though he sees me everywhere he goes\nSo he just tortures himself\nHe has no fortune and wealth\nSo he extorts someone else to get his dough\nAnd now he's acting like a bully\nSo he tries to push and pull me\nBut he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad\nHe has no choice but to scream\nAnd raise his voice up at me\n'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared"}
