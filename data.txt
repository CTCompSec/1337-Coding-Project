{"contents":"I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone\nBorn to live forever through life's struggles\nI cut corners and took drastic measures\nSeen niggas life expire right in front of me\nTime could never mend what these cold streets\nMentally done to me, too often, I close my eyes\nAnd see my own coffin feeling haunted\nReady to leave this world that I'm lost in\nMy only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion\nWhen I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn, keep flossing\nAs long as my name lives on what's most important\nI'll be down in hell scorching preparing for life\nAfterlife still torching and blazing these mics\nIt'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights\nAnd I'd return on the 3rd like Christ\n(Without my physical portion)\nMy spirit a poltergeist for sure\nI'll be back through the Heights tomorrow\nBlood over y'all fake niggas door\nWhat you thought, huh?\nWhat you thought, nigga?"}
