{"contents":"Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled\nPop the same shit that got Tupac killed\nSpit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode\nPunch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes\nThere's three things I hate, girls, women, and bitches (What?)\nI'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets\nThey call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward\nStick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg\nComing through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches\nHit a fucking pregnant bitch in her stomach with luggage\nIt's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out or back out\nLookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out\nI'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers\nFlip you off in French, then translate it to English\nThen I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back\nSpeaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it"}
