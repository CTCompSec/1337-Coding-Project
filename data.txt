{"contents":"I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come\nYou and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme\nWhere the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer\nWhen the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run\nWhere the plans was to get funds and skate off the set\nTo achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet\nFaced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets\nSo I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check\nI'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much\nAnd girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much\nSo they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust\nI don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us\nI'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable\nBoosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new\nYour word was everything, so everything you said you'd do\nYou did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it\nI'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about\nWho's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?\nWhere the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds\nAt each other's throats for the love of foreign cars\nWhere cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's\nBut most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?\nI'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars\nI'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all"}
