{"contents":"You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)\n′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here\nBeen in the dark so long, don't know if the light here\nBut I′m just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)\nAnd now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)\nI deaded those night tears when the night clears"}
