{"contents":"Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense\nI got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse\nI greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans\nI foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans\nMy coiled hands around this microphone are lethal\nOne thought in my cerebral is deeper than a Jeep full of people\nMCs are feeble, I came to 'cause some pandemonium\nBattle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one\nImitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator\nThere's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus\nFuck around and catch all the venereal diseases\nMy thesis will smash a stereo to pieces\nMy a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis\nIt eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally\nWith entity, dementedly meant to be infinite"}
