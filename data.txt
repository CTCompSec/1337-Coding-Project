{"contents":"I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters\nBusters they wanted to rush us\nLove the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya\nWhen you blush you turn blue if your grade is right\nYou can light up the whole room, turning day from night\nWhen the summertime is in and the tops are down\nWith you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)\nIt took short sleeves and lounging to understand\nThe reason they call you ice, everybody freeze\nAin't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you\nAnd that platinum in the charm who can blind like you\nThe direct reason why niggas do the crimes they do\nI used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools\nGuess I was jealous that they was so next to you\nSo I devoted half my time to invest in you\nThe other half was spent on protecting you\n'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me\nC'mon"}
