{"contents":"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo\nI tried suicide once and I'll try it again\nThat's why I write songs where I die at the end\n'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck\nAnd I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', I suck (I suck)\nI go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd\nAnd yell out loud, All y'all get the hell out now\nFuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry\n(But Eminem, this is your record release party)\nI'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer\nAnd nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford\nGuess I'm just a sick, sick bastard\nWho's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)\nOne Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet\nI feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)\nAnd if you ever see a video for this shit\nI'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit"}
