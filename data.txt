{"contents":"Way before my baby daughter Hailie\nI was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey\nAn eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes\nSo every day he'd shove me in the lockers\nOne day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'\nAnd had me in the position to beat me into submission\nHe banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose\nSoaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat\nI tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef\nBut he just wouldn't leave\nHe kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe\nHe looked at me and said, You gonna die, honky\nThe principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me\n(What's going on in here?)\nI made 'em think they beat me to death\nHoldin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left\nThen I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth\nKicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws\nGrabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools\nThis is for every time you took my orange juice\nOr stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk\nEvery time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt\nI'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good\nI cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could\nAnd beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood\nKnocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot\nMade it home later that same day\nStarted readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray\nI couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read\nI went deaf and my left ear started to bleed\nMy mother started screamin', What are you on, drugs?!\nLook at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug (I'm sorry)\nShe beat me over the head with the remote control\nOpened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull\nI picked it up and screamed, Look, bitch, what have you done?\nOh my God, I'm sorry, son\nShut up, you cunt\nI said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head\nThen I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck"}
