{"contents":"My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne\nBut when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)\nI′m in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like light years (Lord)\nMy rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears\n30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier\nIt′s a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)\nIt′s like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)"}
