{"contents":"I looked death in the face years back\nI held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back\nI'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live\nYou gotta bounce back homie, the streets don't give\nI take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?\nNot Rudy Giuliani, not Hillary Rodham\nStill I still pop him\nShit, I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now\nI think big when I spit at you now\nBetween my dog and the figures, the four gonna get you\nBetween life and death, they killed my spirit\nSo what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball\nI empowered myself, teacher said I was a lost cause\n'Cause I used to roam them halls\nStill I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college\nWho woulda thought I'd make it Big like Ms. Wallace?"}
