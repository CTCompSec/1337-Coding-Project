{"contents":"I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)\nI make fight music for high school kids\nI put lives at risk when I drive like this\nI put wives at risk with a knife like this\nShit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now\nI'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out\nDucked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out\nPut it over your mouth, and grab you by the face xe2x80x94 what now?\nOh, you want me to watch my mouth\nHow? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?\nLook, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around\nAnd hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out\nI'm sorry, there must be a mix-up\nYou want me to fix up lyrics\nWhile our President gets his dick sucked?\nFuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts\nMake fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up\nGet aware, wake up, get a sense of humor\nQuit tryin' to censor music\nThis is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)\nBut don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace\nYou shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents"}
