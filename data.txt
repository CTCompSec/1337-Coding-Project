{"contents":"I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps\nSneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs\nInside the depths of his basement\nI taste lint, in my mouth\nThen the lights in the place went\nI saw my life flash in front of my eyes\nI felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs\nNone of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed\nThen I remembered the flashlight in my costume"}
