{"contents":"There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell\nA place called prison and a place called jail\nAnd Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one\n'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson\nAnd you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)\nMaybe when you're old enough\nTo understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya\nBut for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad\nWas bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad\nBut I still feel sad that I put her on time out\nSit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out\nI told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?\nTake a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?\nHer make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee\nClean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty\nYour dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water\n'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter"}
