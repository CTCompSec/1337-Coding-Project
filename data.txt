{"contents":"One day I plan to be a family man happily married\nI wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried\n'Til I'm glad to be buried\nAnd leave this crazy world\nAnd have at least a half a million for my baby girl\nIt may be early to be planning this stuff\n'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough\n'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough\nI've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed\nMy hands have been cuffed\nBut I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff\nOr plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts\nI'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been troubled enough\nAnd I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see\nMy destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased\nWith my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese\nI'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call\nWay before my baby is able to crawl\nI'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates\nTo know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades\nI seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth\nWhere they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu"}
