{"contents":"I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet\nI'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat\nI translate when my voice is read through a seismograph\nAnd the noise is spread\nPicked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uh)\nTrap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed\n'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead\nTold him each one of his boys is dead (Oh)\nI asked him to come to the dark side\nHe made a choice and said (Yo)\nWho hard? Yo, I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity\nHolds that of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level\nIs hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist\nInterceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse\nAnd stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation\nCollaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth"}
