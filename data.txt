{"contents":"So now you own a record label, I got one too\nWe on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew\nYou can treat us like convicts, you know we got records\nOn the shelf and on the charts the double decker\nThe fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me\nYou criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?\nI'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways\nSo I can get paid, everyday\nI see the same old shit, I see in the streets\nI know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats\nDope fiend music, it's drug-related\nYou can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it\nIt always sounds better when you turn it up loud\nRap music let these motherfuckers know what we about\nI know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas\nIt's just like in the streets mane, how much you get?"}
