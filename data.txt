Screw it\nAnd what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?\nAnd what's a little fight?\nTomorrow you'll be boys again\nIt's your life\nLive it however you wanna\nMarijuana is everywhere\nWhere was you brought up?\nIt don't matter as long as you get where you're going\nxe2x80x98Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'\nThey tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring\nEven though you wake up feeling like shit every morning"}
