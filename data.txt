{"contents":"Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous\nLiving as scandalous as a television evangelist\nBut I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter\nCaped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters\nI think we live in era meant for me\nExperimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally\nWhen I stumbled upon this resolution\nBy using a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion\nYou couldn't see me with binoculars\nI'm armed like an octopus\nStep on stage and you get socked and pushed\nTalking that junk like you had Black Bart at your back\nCome to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act\nWhen I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it\nEvery minute so when I win it you never resent it\nI'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented\nYou got the point when I cleverly sent it"}
