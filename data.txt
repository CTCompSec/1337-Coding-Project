{"contents":"Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up\nWhen motherfuckers hate your guts\nYou ain't even gotta say much\nFor me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper\nIs like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush\nI can't explain what it is my brain does\nBut however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts\nAnd it ain't just my brain that's dangerous\nIt's a whole combination of things, it takes nuts\nAnd I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up\nI got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks\nFor anybody who gets on the track and spanks us\nI'm patiently waiting for the day, I'm anxious\nTo see the look on ya fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt\nYa drunk, you ain't tough\nWhatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas\nThis is me talking, motherfucker, this ain't drugs\nYou wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up\nFuck that! It's too late chump, now face up\nI pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does\nOpens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off\nOr rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off\nSo I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw\nAnd give him the surgery that he came for\n'Til I pull the paint off, I never been shot\nBut I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth\n'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain when they try to rush him\nAnd lost and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it\nI don't stop, only thing that I wait for\nIs the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court\n'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more\n'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw\nA lot of rappers on my list that just ain't Ja\nAnd I'ma read that motherfucker off come April\nYou pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile\nWhen I come back I'll be shooting more than just paintballs\nTrust me"}
