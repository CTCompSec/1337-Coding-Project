When I was back home\nI'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome\nOn any Martin Luther, don't part with your future\nDon't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya\nThe answer is simply too dark for the user\nAnd as a snot-nose they said that he got flows\nBut will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?\n'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone\nFrom what the block has spoken, my God\nEverybody stressing, who's his baby's moms?\nWho he got pregnant, let me tell you, ah"}
