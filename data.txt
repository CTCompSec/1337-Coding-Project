{"contents":"For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped\n'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with\nI just can't get past these little piss ants\nThat wanna be brawny bad asses so bad\nAnd they so mad they can't stand it\n'Cause we can and they can't spit\nAnd they can't handle it like a man\nAnd that's when it just happens\nAnd I snap and it's a wrap, and it's scrap and then it isn't rap, is it?\nHip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit\nMaybe I'm old-fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him\nBelieve me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now\nBut it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic\n'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it\n'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me\nYou poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B\nThese words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me\n'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50\nI'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone\nLike Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally\nI do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy &amp; Proof, are you with me?"}
