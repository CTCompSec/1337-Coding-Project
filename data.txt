{"contents":"I'm still on top of the game\nStill dropping flames, still cock and aim\nStill at the top, had to rock for the fame\nOver setbacks, there's been a lot since I came\nYou seen it all, how I got, how I gained\nThe momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain\nWhen I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim\nThe streets, they made a special spot for my name\nDre, haters want a stop to my reign\nBut the music lives in me, every drop in my veins\nThe pride and the pain\nAll the way back from the rise of my name\nSee the world clear through the eyes of the man\nSee the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave\nWhen the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played\nThe best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher"}
