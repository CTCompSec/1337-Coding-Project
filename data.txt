{"contents":"Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad\nWhen I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\n'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?\nDaddy's with you in your prayers\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\nDaddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?\nYeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world\nWhen it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls\nTwo little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze\nI know it's confusing you\nDaddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us\nI don't see us ever being together ever again\nLike we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream"}
