{"contents":"Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms\nIn a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe\nI cream, I diamond gleam\nHigh post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop\nBrooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam\nNiggas wanna try to hem my long jeans\nUptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene\nIn the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean\nLiaison for days on end\nMoney make the world go around so I made some to spend\nCan I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow\nLike the Mississippi Riv', looking jig\nCan't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo\nThat's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto\nThug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson\nI played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano\nYou ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns\nHorizontal, get your weight up, I am\nTwo point two pounds\nYou're barely a hundred and twenty five grams\nWouldn't expect y'all to understand this money\nDo the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish\nCrews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?"}
