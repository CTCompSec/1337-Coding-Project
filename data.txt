{"contents":"There's no mountain I can't climb\nThere's no tower too high\nNo plane that I can't learn how to fly\nWhat do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you\nThere ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to\nFuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls\nI cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar\nInside of a hall, with my framed autographed\nSunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall\nI'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off\nAll this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off"}
