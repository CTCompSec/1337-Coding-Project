{"contents":"Last seen out of state where I drop my sling\nI'm deep in the South kicking up top game\nBouncing on the highway switching four lanes\nScreaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing\nYour worst fear confirmed\nMe and my fam roll tight like The Firm\nGetting down for life, that's right, you better learn\nWhy play with fire, you burn\nWe get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire\nWe do dirt like worms, produce Gs like sperm\n'Til legs spread like germs\nI got extensive hoes with expensive clothes\nAnd I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows\nWhat y'all don't know?\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle"}
