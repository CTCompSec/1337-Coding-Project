{"contents":"It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe\nThat he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes\nI don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot\nTime to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute\nJumped out like a star with the flavest car\nMatching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors\nThese young niggas think I fell out the loop\n'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe\nI hopped out in a suit\nLook at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine\nI didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind\nPlus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff\nTaking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff\nThey had me thinking, Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff\nWhile he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff.\nSwear to God, they had me practically hating his guts\nAs he approached I spoke, Jigga, what up?"}
