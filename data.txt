{"contents":"A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only\nHear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom\nLots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)\nRisked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm\nKeep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)\nJust to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said"}
