{"contents":"Some days I sit starin' out the window\nWatchin' this world pass me by\nSometimes I think there's nothin' to live for\nI almost break down and cry\nSometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy\nWhy am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?\nBut then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy\nIt all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no"}
