{"contents":"[Kuniva:]\nLet's see how many of your men loyal\nWhen I pull up looking for you with a pistol\nSipping a can of Pennzoil\nI'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust\nYour head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed\nTossed in the paddy-wagon\nBragging about how you shouted like a coward\nBullets devoured you, showered you niggas\nIf I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance\nUnderstand, I can enhance the spirit of man\nDeath itself, it can't hurt me\nJust the thought of dying alone that really irks me\nYou ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk\nBe smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark\nHug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life\nFuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife\nDeliver that shit that coroners like\nYou hype, popping shit in broad daylight\nNigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops"}
