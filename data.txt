{"contents":"Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up\nJigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up\nY'all ain't ready to workout with the boy\nYour flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids\nI lift every voice when I sing, my ability\nMake yours look like an exercise in futility\nBring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads\nWe don't struggle with undeveloped muscles\nY'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel\nSame routine when you see me you know the drill\nI spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch\nOff your arm, remain nice and calm\nPut down your things, Trinidad of the game\nKnow my way around your ring\nNo matter how many pounds you bring\nIt sounds like the same old thing\nR-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers"}
