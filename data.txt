{"contents":"My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams\nI'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings\nI feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished\nLivin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished\nAnd I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay\nAnd I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play\n'Cause when we die, we know we're all goin' the same way\n'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan\nOr comfortable and roomy in a 6\nBut they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics\nWho walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day\nAnd yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play\nLive half my life and throw the rest away"}
