{"contents":"Well, it's Friday and it's my day\nJust to party all the way to Sunday\nMaybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day\nEvery day's just a holiday\nCruisin' on the freeway\nFeelin' kinda breezy\nGot the top down, lettin' my hair blow\nI don't know where I'm goin'\nAll I know is when I get there\nSomeone's gonna touch my body"}
