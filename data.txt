{"contents":"So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib\nOnly thing is, we both know where this kid lives\nAnd neither one of us have Canadian citizenship\nShit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!\nAll we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost\nWe can fly over the border! Let's Go!\nSo we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed\nWhat was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.\nFuck it, keep goin', no time to waste\nWait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.\nOkay, fuck, now he's draggin' under the car\nOh well, only thirty more thousand miles!\nMeanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate\nJust tryna find a reason for the constant hate\nAnd tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'\nHe couldn't have fell off that hard. Ain't no way!\nWhat happened to the way you was rappin'\nWhen you was scandalous?\nThat Canibus turned into a television evangelist!\nPlus, he raps with his regular voice\nWhat was that? Pet Shop Boys.\nSo, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted\nHis corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted\nAnd he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love\nI figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done\nSo I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'xe2x80x94Christ!\nHe won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!\nHe's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more\nBut he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw\nHold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!\nPunch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch\nDo something! At least one punchline!\nCome on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-\nTy nine percent of my fans are blond!\n'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!\nTell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!\nIntergalactical metaphors from Mars!\nRaw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!\nBite another line from Redman's song!\nSuddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm\nFrom a midget reaches out from under the car\nIt's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!\nDre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether\nWe swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again\nCompton! Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!\nStomp him! Switch feet! Stomp him! Switch again!\nDre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!\nI think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again! (Ahh!)\nDamn, He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"}
