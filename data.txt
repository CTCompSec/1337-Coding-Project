{"contents":"Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?\nI have; I've been protested and demonstrated against\nPicket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times\nSick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind\nAll this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding\nTempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going\nNot taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing\nKeep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening\nLeave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth\nSee they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out\nLook at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?\nI'mma make you look so ridiculous now"}
