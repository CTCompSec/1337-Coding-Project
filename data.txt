{"contents":"You know I move like an ounce\nBottled up like crack\nThat's how I make you bounce like that\nDefy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that\nThat's why no other rapper got a sound like that\nTrap, trap of my life\nFlashback, kill niggas\nRap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby\nI can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it\nGod given, guess it was all for hard living\nFar be it from me to question Allah's wisdom\nCould've been lost in the system\nInstead I'm involved with the rhythm\nI dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions\nI know I must be part of some mission\nShit, I used take it for granted\nWhy they placed me on this planet\nI would ask myself while writing raps to myself\nBut right there under my nose\nWas the flow of all flows\nNot a demon but a rose in the cement, come on"}
