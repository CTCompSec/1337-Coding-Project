{"contents":"I'd tell Big they're still hearing his songs\nRun into Pac ask him where we went wrong\nTell him life is miserable when ya dealing in the physical form\nIs everything that's invisible gone?\nI need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?\nWill I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?\nCan I re, veal the game to all the hustlers\nTrapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?\nCan I puff cigars and drink Cristal?\nIf this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?\nCan I still touch lives, answer their whats and whys\nMake sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?\nIf I should die, don't cry, my niggasnrnI'm rolling with Roc-A-Fella, man\n'Cause they got money, man, ha ha"}
