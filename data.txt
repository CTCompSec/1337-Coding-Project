{"contents":"Late one night I was, rolling the streets\nJust, thinking about what's going 'on with me and\nTrapped in this thug life, trying to break free but\nThis thug life just keeps calling me\nI'm living life way too dangerously\nI'm drowning in my misery\nLooked in the mirror, there's my enemy\n'Cause poppa never was a part of me\nTake one step at a time, mama said\nSweet memories still remain in my head\nAll of my life been lied to, misled\nVoices be like, Don't you wish you was dead?\nNo ground to place my feet\nI feel the fire under me\nA way out is all I need\nSomebody, answer me!"}
