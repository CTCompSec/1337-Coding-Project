{"contents":"The only thing hotter than my flow is the block\nThat's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz\nLet's get this clear, it ain't on 'til I say it's on, it's on\nI'm eating, ya'll niggas fasting like it's Ramadan\nBowlish way in Lebanon know 50 the bomb\nI be at the edge of the bar sipping a Don\nI keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on\nThis word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong\nYou want war? I take you to war now that my money long\nWhy you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize\nThe way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in\nWhile I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters\nYa'll should hate the game not the players, come on"}
