{"contents":"Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness\nAs I provide just enough spark that we need\nTo proceed, carry on, give me hope\nGive me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong\nPut your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog\nTo the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge\nWe gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp\nWe gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on"}
