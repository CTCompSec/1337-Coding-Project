{"contents":"Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right\nI'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime\nMy slick a capella sounds clever with the beats\nBoy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets\nForget a gold digger's succubus, my soul's thick with ruggedness\nWith the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this"}
