{"contents":"Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet\nAnd I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch\n'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake\nI maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun\n'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show"}
