{"contents":"I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and\nBullets'll follow 'em and\nThere's so much coke that you could run the slalom\nAnd cops comb the shit top to bottom\nThey say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home\nWhere personalities clash and chrome meets chrome\nThe coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes\nBut this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown\nAll over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone\nWelcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell\nBut when them shells come, you better return 'em\nAll scars, we earn 'em\nAll cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand\nWe watch for cops hopping out the back of vans\nWear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan\nThis ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it\nWas clapping them flamers before I became famous\nFor playing me, y'all shall forever remain nameless"}
