{"contents":"Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing\nBut put yourself in my position; just try to envision\nWitnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing\nGoing through public housing systems, victim of Mxc3xbcnchausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach\nDoesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?\nBut guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony\nAnd Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!\nSee what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get\nYou selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?\nWell guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!"}
