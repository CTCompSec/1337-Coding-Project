{"contents":"It's the money that makes shit get ugly\nIt's the money that makes these hoes love me\nIt's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me\nMan, I thought the money would make it all lovely\nYo, I actually write what I do and see\nThe felonies from day to day make me say what I say\nWhen I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's\nDon't cry for me, smile for me\nAnd if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me\nRemember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed\nAnd all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack\nLet my tombstone read \"I Tried\" and from the start\nEverything I wrote was from my heart\nSo it's always gon' be number one on my chart\nI get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art\nSometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'\nThis shit is real, it ain't a game"}
