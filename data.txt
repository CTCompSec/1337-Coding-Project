{"contents":"The more you put me through\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more\nYou don't want me, I just want you more\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me\nI know it's sad but it's makin' me happy\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on\n'Cause you love me, and I love you more"}
