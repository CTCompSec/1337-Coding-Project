{"contents":"Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to you)\nPressing on the gas, supernova for a night light\nScreaming at my Dad, and he told me, \"It ain't Christ-like\"\nBut nobody never tell you when you′re being like Christ\nOnly ever seein′ me only when they needin' me\nLike if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET\nSearching for a deity, now you wanna see it free\nNow you wanna see if we, let′s just see if three apiece\nTell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light"}
