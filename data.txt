{"contents":"On repeat, the CD of Big's Me &amp; My Bitch\nWatching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit\nEmpty gun in your hand, saying, Let me see that clip!\nShopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick\nA nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip\nYou helped me get the keys to that V dot 6\nWe was so happy poor, but when we got rich\nThat's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped\nRather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit\nMade me speed that quick, let me see. That's it\nIt was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick\nI used to cut up their buddies, now they're saying they love me\nUsed to tell their friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me\nThen I showed up in that dubbed out buggy\nAnd then they got fuzzy\nAnd they don't remember that, and I don't remember you"}
