{"contents":"I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough\nPlus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough\nI make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks\nHad it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6\nGot your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent\nGot her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what\nSo I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt\nAt the bar alchoholing her up\nI represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream\nA buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth\nJay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name\nI ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game\nFrom now until they blow holes in my frame\nI'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?\nI'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime\nOn the low though, shh, the city is mine!"}
