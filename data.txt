{"contents":"Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress\nGot up out the streets you think a nigga could rest\nCan't even enjoy myself at a party unless\nI'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest\nYou think I'm freaking these chicks, right?\nI try not to brush against their chest\nYou get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped\nSwear to everything when I leave this earth\nIt's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt\nYou could try me fucker but when I squeeze it hurts, fine\nWe'll lose two lives, yours and mines\nGimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve\nAt the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve\nTold the judge didn't budge it was him or me\nAnd I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged\nPut my mercy on this court and my faith in God\nAnd pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me"}
