{"contents":"Em, it's Paul.\nListen, Joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind his studio, shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.\nI told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.\nYou're gonna get yourself in trouble.\nDon't bring your gun outside of your home. You can't carry it on you.\nLeave your fuckin' gun at home.Word"}
