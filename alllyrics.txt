Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfucking mind
(For MCs, MCs)
We represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?
Yo they don't know shit about this
For the '96

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing, the zany-acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration
Hits a snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a Jeep full of people
MCs are feeble, I came to 'cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

'95, '96 ('96)
And on and on and on (and on and on)

Yeah, soul intent, checking in number one, baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is MC Proof and DJ Head!

Checkin' in on W.E.G.O.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay, yo, we got the number-one requested song (alright) of the day coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called It's OK

Check it out
Hey Kyu!

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been troubled enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep

Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Man what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick a capella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus, my soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this

I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, and you's a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running past the gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance? No we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Now what you know about a sweet MC from the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed your casket closed you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner than Jeru jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow follower singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think we live in era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a diss, 'cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, rhythm romantically
Freaking vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease, tryna clear it

Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother
And unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just slows down
And then speeds back to a regular pace
There is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry
But you keep on actin' strangely

I met this girl last week
She was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said, Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Throughout my hands, and said, Oh, it's like that?
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said, Maxine, check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things
What the fuck are you doin'?
So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said, 3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass
I said What is it? Another nigga? It's OK
She said, No I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem.

Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third, nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see,
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'

Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MCs, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse
I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends tryna make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
(Ayo, let me get that mic, man)
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
Who the fuck passed you the mic?!
(I got the rhymes, bitch, I'll kick that shit)

Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', cold as hell
Yes, it is. Hey, bus didn't come here, didn't he?
No. Hey look, you got 15 cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store. Alright, man?
Quick, 'cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know. You know what? Ayy look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car. You know what I'm sayin'?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin' is different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man? 'Cause that's it. Yeah.
A million dollars ain't even that far away, man.
Yo, we got to get the money, man!
I can't be broke for the rest of my life!
Yeah, I hear what your sayin'. Look, there's got to be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man.
Bummin' rides everywhere I go.
Yeah, what's up with Lexus's and Land Cruisers?

Yo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just
Choose the few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue par
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh

That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor.
I want to be president.
Yo, forgot that president, man.
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that. You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, man.
Hahaha, but don't all, you know?
You only live once, '96, baby

[Angela Workman:]
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby

[Eminem:]
I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
I love you (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

[Angela Workman:]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

[Eye-Kyu:]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pxc3xa9rignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the nxc3xa9gligxc3xa9e

[Angela Workman:]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

Jealous?! What he mean jealous?
Know what I'm sayin'? He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes
He bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes
That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean,

I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me
When you kiss me, then you diss me
And we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do
When all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch
That ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company
Now you're always pumpin' me for information
And you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
'Cause every accusation
Makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in
I need my second windxe2x80x94say what?!

Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

Fuck you and what you going through! Fuck Eminem!
He just mad 'cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad 'cause I'm gettin' it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just tryin' to get this pussy

I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feet prints
And tappin' in your phone conversations
Through the heat ventsxe2x80x94it made complete sense
There's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, Who was Mike?
And you was like, (I need a new nigga)
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow.
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken-hearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock
But now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, You didn't want me to see yo' hon
Don't want me now, take the towel, wipe your brow!
Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now your tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'allxe2x80x94fellas, sing it!

Jealo-!
Jealousy!
Jealousy!

No!

I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, Bitch, you got a sick kid
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?
Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed
Low down dirty even I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Life by Marshall Mathers

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word

Whoa, a-get your hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&amp;M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

(Shit, fuck everybody)
Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)
D.U.

[*The sound of a body being dragged across the ground. The body is thrown in the trunk of a car, which is then closed shut.*]

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee (whoosh)
There goes Mama, splashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby

Yeah, ha ha ha (Bang!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like Gs, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell, Everybody get out!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways xe2x80x94 do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a hand basket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window, Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', Get the cops, quick!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', Stop it!
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) xe2x80x94 Ain't nobody iller than me

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', Freeze!
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face, Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, Fuck itxe2x80x94mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', Truce-truce! (Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady, you a basehead (Uh-uh)
Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, Let's just be friends
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steaming mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go in, and gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A., Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ah
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?
He said, Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, Try to fake a stomach ache, it works
I screamed, Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse
What's the matter?
I don't know, my leg, it hurts
Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, You gonna die, honky
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, Look, bitch, what have you done?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, son
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage

Em, what's going on?
This is Paul Rosenberg, your faithful attorney at law
Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album
And, uh, y'know, I've just got to be honest with you
Can you tone it down a little bit?
Because there's only so much I can explain
Give me a call

Life by Marshall Mathers

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my Word

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee (whoosh)
There goes Mama, splashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, babyWord

[Zoe on telephone]
Justin? 
It's Zoe um 
Kelly did not have me call however I just listened to Eminem in her car and 
It is the most disgusting, thing I have ever heard in my entire life 
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent 
And tell him how fucking disgusting he is 
It like makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
GoodbyeWord

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like meWord

For all the ladies out there
OK
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you lie in the corner cryingWord

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?
It's me and Kelly!
My bad (Sorry)
Let's try another room
I don't trust you
Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods
Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab
Oh dag (Mmm)
I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag
Huh?

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (I'm sorry)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Yo, Sue
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's trippin'
I need to go puke (Blehh)
I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)
She said, Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure
I said, I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me
She said, I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful
Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you
He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude
Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?
Well, it depends on how many you had
I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol
She's gonna die, dude
I know and it's my fault
Oh my God

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up
Oh my GodWord

I'm gonna call this motherfucker
Oh, fuck yeah
Give him a piece of my mind, a piece of my ass

(Thank you for waiting, hello, may I help you?)
Oh, thank you, I need to make a collect call
(What number?)
Oh, the number is **6-2***
(At the tone, please say your name)
Kenneth Kaniff from Connecticut, automated piece of shit

Yo
Hey there, cock boy
Who's this?
This is Ken Kaniff
Who?
Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, you little bitch
From Connecticut?
Yeah, you wanna get a-
I don't know nobody in Connecticut
You wanna get a hotel room with me?
A hotel room?
Yeah, you want me to lick your ass, Eminem?
Yo, who is this, Cage?
Hey, you want me to fuckin' melt in your mouth and not in your hand?
Melt in your ass, you little cock boy
Yo, shut up, you lil bitch
Oh, you think I'm lyin', huh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haWord

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Yo, mic check
(Woo, shit) Testing
One, two, um, twelve
What up? What up? What up? (Outsiderz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me? (Outsiderz)
(Rah Digga, Young Zee, bust it, bust it)
Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(I can't stand white people)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
(Yo can you sign this right here?)
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)
Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', I suck (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, All y'all get the hell out now
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Cum on everybody (Get down tonight)

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, Gee, I don't know, he might be
I told 'em, Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster (Okay)
Peace out (Bye-bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we're all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you're wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you're sad enough to tear
That's rock bottomWord

Whoa, a-get your hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&amp;M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)

(I don't know) Yes, man

Trials and tribulations

It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, What up? It's nice to meet ya (Hi)
I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said, Come in, it's unlocked
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, No, please let go
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ah (Come here, take this motherfuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning
(I don't know why this world keeps turning)Word

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed Fuck the world
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ah, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my nameWord

I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9

I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Oh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ah)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' MCs, at the same time amazin' MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what's up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?Word

A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (Here, Momma, try 'em on)
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my assWord

It's like this and like that and like this
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mind state
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend can jump off of a bridge
And if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die nowWord

Yo, mic-check (My dick)
Testing, one, two, fuck (My dick)
My nuts

My attitude is worse than N.W.A.'s was
I'll battle you over stupid shit
And diss people who ain't have shit to do with it
Like Cool J does (My tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children
I look at my life in a new light
Fuck it, give me two mics
I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (Oh, hell yeah)
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)
Don't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em
(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen
Lesson 3, get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
(Here, listen)
Lesson 4, know you heard this before
Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure
Don't act like a fan, you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&amp;R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)
Lesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ugh)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said, See ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in
And caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass
While you're out siphonin' gas
For your lawn mower to cut the grass

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
(Yo, why you diss me?)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a bunch of shit you wished you had
(A big dick)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi, Renxc3xa9e (Oh, hi)
I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away (What?)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?
Blood drippin' from it
Rippin' your stomach like a paper mxc3xa2chxc3xa9
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe
Snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage
And sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)
The demon is here, I'm steamin' this year
I rip [?] voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah, I don't think this guy is well
I'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat
When I'm swingin' him by his tail
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off, then sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Christopher Reeves
I was dealing with strep throat
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathing machines
Flashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a bunch of shit you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (Yup)
Sway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)
And we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)
Or a damn or a fuck or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin' dick
The Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me
It mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys
Hip-hop, baby, all the way, foreverWord

This is another public service announcement
Brought to you in part by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a fuck)
Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass!
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
(Yeah)
Uh, anything else?

Yeah, sue me!Word

When I was just a little baby boy,
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me

But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!

These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit 'cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you

Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?
Oh, now he's raping his own mother,
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?

You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinnn!

Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

Bitch I'mma kill you!
Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em

I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th

Bitch I'mma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times in a tub
But that's normal ain't it Norman?

Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me

I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece!

Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?

Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school

I don't even believe in breathing
I'm leaving air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK, I'm ready to go play
I got the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

You faggots keep egging me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talking to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Or I'mma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefing I don't squash the beef

You better kill me! I'mma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me
Bitch I'mma kill you!

You don't wanna fuck with Shady ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why not?)
'Cause Shady will fucking kill you..

I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love youWord

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air Tonight
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,xe2x80x94shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
[*car tires squeal, crash, loud splash*]

[Eminem:]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you
Damn!Word

Em, what's going on, it's Paul,
Umm, Dre gave me a copy of the new album and I just,
[sigh]
Fuck it.Word

(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I'd)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music (No)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face xe2x80x94 what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, Go! with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you would've been
If you would've been in my shoes, who would've thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you would've bought?
That would've made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big

Good to see you again. What's up?
[Steve:] Em, could you come in here and have a seat, please?
[Eminem:] Um, yeah, what's,
[Steve:] Vanessa? Shut the door
[Vanessa:] Okay [door creaks shut:]
[Eminem:] So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
[Steve:] It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
[Eminem:] Wh,
[Steve:] This album is less than nothing. I can't sell this fucking record
[Eminem:] Wha,
[Steve:] Do you know what's happening to me out there?
[Eminem:] Wh-wha-what's the problem?
[Steve:] Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
[Eminem:] Who's Violet,?

Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass! 
Do you know what it feels like 
To be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
[Eminem:] But, I,

I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this 
You know why Dre's record was so successful? 
He's rappin' about big-screen TVs, blunts, 40s and bitches. 
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicodin
[Eminem:] I mean-
[Steve:] I can't sell this shit!
[Eminem:] What,

Whatever
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet), in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn), and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Having this happening (this happening)
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is, 
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions (fucking questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I amWord

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the, Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*Vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who. Yeah, but he's so cute though!
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals.. Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming I don't give a fuck!
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, Hi
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, xe2x80x98cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
[*Scratches*] My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational [*scratch*] Back is the incredible!
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it.
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call mexe2x80x94

They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
xe2x80x98Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
xe2x80x98Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ah!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
xe2x80x98Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't minexe2x80x94what's my name?

I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt [*sighs*] fuckWord

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
(Grrrr, arf arf) Or leaning out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (God damnit!)
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screaming, I don't care, just bite me (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves Clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(Ah!) Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all running your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus, you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy
My fuckin bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your [attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot!
Talking about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
OK, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
Uh, here, double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ah fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Because I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)

Fuck you guys! (Wait, what- wait, Ken!)
If you want Eminem, you can have Eminem! (Wha-a-a-)
Fuck you guys, I'mma leaving! (No- i-e-o- no!)
No! Ken, wait! I-I- [*door slams*]
Aw, damn!
Nice going, Shaggy!Word

Yeah, hahahaha,whooooo, shit!
Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet,
I'll come in a minute
Ayo,This is my love song,it goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
(fuckin' faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning
You're beginnin' to think women
Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes
That bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up

Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place
Now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play

I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like
Yo, what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch
You know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you

But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
xe2x80x98Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of meWord

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville

I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoot)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too)
That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

He's mentally ill from Amityville
He'll accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't, goddammit he will
He's mentally ill from Amityville
He's mentally ill from Amityville

This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I,

Somehow, some way
Hello, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son (Yeah)
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the faxc3xa7ade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

And you don't really wanna fuck with me

Aww look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

[Eminem (Kim):]
(Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying, bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you
Just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at, Kim
Look at your husband now!
(No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride, bitch
(No!)
Sit up front
(Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone. What if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back
Well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only 18
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh, God, my brain is racing
(I love you!)
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
(No!)
There's a four-year-old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you?
(No!)
Bullshit, you bitch, don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that!)
No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god, I hate you
Oh, my god, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Come on, get out
(I can't, I'm scared)
I said get out, bitch!
(Let go of my hair.
Please don't do this, baby
Please I love you, look we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you
You did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh, my God, I'm crackin' up
Get a grip, Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh, my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've, Hey! Where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! Ha! Got'cha!
(Ah!)
Ha! Go ahead, yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah, somebody help!
Don't you get it, bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! Bitch, bleed!
Bleed! Bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without youWord

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Swifty:]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, Forgive me
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Eminem:]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit

'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit

[Bizarre:]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Proof:]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin, nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Kuniva:]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', Kuniva, yo, yo!
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Kon Artis:]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Eminem:]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's yes

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail.
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen. A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went , when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The Maniac's in in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird

And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (Hi, Bob!)
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, Knock it off!
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want itxe2x80x94it's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasyxe2x80x94it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm,)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) [*fart*] (Ew, ahh!)

America, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?

I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life
And now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, babyxe2x80x94ooh, baby!xe2x80x94look at my sales

Let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it! until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now
It's

White America, I could be one of your kids

I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke
Tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this
Like I don't like this
Nope

All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem
In Harlem
Only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flak
From these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper
To smack a bitch, or say faggot

Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild
The motherfuckin' spokesman now for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy

Fuck you, Ms. Cheney
Fuck you, Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

I'm just playin', America, you know, I love youWord

Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile, let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't want to be
Anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, Holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on
In Gotham when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say
They get hated on in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a hell yeah? (Hell yeah!)

Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone! Thank you for coming!
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! HehWord

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones. There you go
Yeah, yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Mxc3xbcnchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closetWord

People! It feels so good to be back
Ladies and gentleman, introducing the new and improved you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push
No friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash
All this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now
I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can-I-Bitch don't want no beef with Slim?
No!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick
Lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

And square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track
Yeah kick on back
Boo!
The boogie monster of rap
Yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
This white hot light
That I'm under
No wonder
I look so sunburnt
Oh no
I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave
Won't go nowhere
Do-si-do
Oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh 'til your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
Till you fuck around
Get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran Wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
Fuckin' assassins hi-jackin' Amtraks crashing
All this terror America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby
Gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now
Eating their food and their baked beans
I'm 28
They gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein you say Shady
My views ain't changed still Inhumane
Wait
Arraigned two days late
The date's today

There's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit
Produce hits to break
the monotony

Drugs, rock and Hennessy
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees
Got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be hungry
Like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee
I can get you jumped for free

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain
For weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'

Willin' to stick out my neck
For respect
If it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me
People just want to see
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel
it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation
Ain't no conversation
If you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
Tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collar bones crush or crumble

I love pissin' you off
It gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse
Anything I do bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2
Who needs bullets
as soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em
And come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds
Assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much

Even if my collar bones crush or crumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy
Until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a

I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm

Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look
At nothin', this world's too much
I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good
Just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out
But I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up
Thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father
So not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps of my dad
'Cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
If you could understand why I am the way that I am

I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is whack
This is more than I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein'
Everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing
It's fuckin' crazy
'Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

Obie, yo

Damn, you straight, dog?

For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
Don't stop!xe2x80x94response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner (Yeah)
When I dropped off my outfit she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, 'cause my dick was unprotected (Damn!)
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks

That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
xe2x80x98Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick

Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Quicker than a shock
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

You waited this long now stop debating
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you, Debbie!

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

KidsWord

Em, it's Paul.
Listen, Joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind his studio, shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.
You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
Don't bring your gun outside of your home. You can't carry it on you.
Leave your fuckin' gun at home.Word

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can,

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayWord

You high, baby?

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Ooh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit
You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice?
Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be? My new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day

'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go

Ooh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

First thing you say
I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces, uh, that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though

Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

'Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't ['want her' backwards]
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, andxe2x80x94

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, wellxe2x80x94I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess whatxe2x80x94Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you [*smooch*]Word

[Eminem:] This motherfuckin' man,
[Berman:] It's ridiculous! I can't believe it!! Hol-hold on a minute, Em,
[Eminem:] What up?
[Berman:] Have a seat,Dre, I'll call you back
[Eminem:] What now???
[Berman:] I don't even know where to start
[Eminem:] Okay,
[Berman:] I got the album from upstairs,
[Eminem:] And,
[Berman:] And this is by far, the most,,
[Gunshot]
[Berman, gasping:] Incredible thing, I've ever, heard,Word

[Bizarre:]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids, Psych!

[Eminem:]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Swifty McVay:]
Ain't no getting rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbours for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dying, you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Kon Artis:]
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends
Turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Begging with their hands out
Checking for your record when it's selling
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think Damn! when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Kuniva:]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol
Sipping a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

[Proof:]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, Woof!
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Bizarre:]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to Rock the Bells
NWA said Fuck the Police, now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&amp;B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
And a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stopsWord

Heh, so I'm out the game, huh? (Huh, huh)
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm wit' ya, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age xe2x80x94 But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine! He don't belong speakin' mine
Or Timbaland's name and don't think I don't read
Your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
And I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and
On top again, there's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm about
Fast cars and Alizxc3xa9, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact
And I'm gone, and I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad xe2x80x94 And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract
On your head, you headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest in something to protect
Your head and neck xe2x80x94 And it's back and forth
All day, like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death; five mics in The Source?
Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
'Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dickWord

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andrxc3xa9 from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney xe2x80x94 Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat meWord

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
Who's your daddy?

[Hailie:]
Daddy, what're you doing?

[Eminem and Hailie:]
OK then! Everybody, listen up!

[Eminem:]
I'm going to Hell, who's comin' with me?

[Hailie:]
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad gone crazy!

There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

[Dr Dre:]
Suck it Marshall

[Eminem:]
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby

[Hailie:]
My dad's lost it

[Eminem:]
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell 'em baby
[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddammit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Than quit bringing my flows, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why I'm so mean? If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

[Hailie:]
Dad

[Eminem:]
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell 'em baby

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump N' Grind comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
Screaming at the sky, 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, Parents are pissed, but the kids love
it
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Eminem:]
There's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
A little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell 'em baby

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy!

[Eminem:]
Crazy

[Hailie:]
You're funny daddy!Word

[Ken Kaniff:]
Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again,
Ken is back, tell some,men
Rub my back, rub my back, rub my back, rub my back,
Eh, Wait, Hello?
Eh, GoodnightWord

Psst, hey, listen
(Da da da da da da da da da daaaa)
Haha, I love my job (Woo!)
Makes me feel like,Superman! Haha
(Da da da da da da da da da daaaa)
Can you fly? I can, wannan see?

I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because

I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids'll copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, 'cause

I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked-up young kids
At a alarming rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim, you great!
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place you that can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you

Green Lantern (That's Right)
G-G-G-G-G Uni-[*burp*]
Shit!
Hahaha, Shady
We back (Invasion!) Part II
The Conspiracy

'Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us 'cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
(Shady Records mixtape, come on Em)

They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up, you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby, this is Shady
I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good-good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
Trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months!

Haha, Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicksWord

Yeah
Shady (Ha-ha)
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, What up?, keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja, what up, dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me

You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Tony!

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Lloyd Banks!

Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, motherfucker

I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You know you don't want it with me

Put his foot through it and crawl in it like a tunnel
From the 313 to the 810

Who the fuck taught you to smoke? Bill Clinton?

Look at you guys, you're makin' a mess, where's Jason?

Shit, tonight, man, I ain't holdin' 'em up
I'm openin' up shop to the cops and closin' it shut
Nineteen shots might seem like a lot, but it's not
I ain't even buzzin', man, I swear to God
Tom, stop, you're gonna scare the dog
He's gonna bark and Mr. Johnson's gonna come downstairs, and, ugh
Hey, I want some peace and quiet here
Or I'ma send the goddamn police in riot gear
Shut up, Mr. Johnson, don't even start
Go have another fuckin' heart attack, you old fart

What's the matter, you can't go to the damn bathroom?
Sorry, I had to shit, dude, where's the tissue?

You prolly did it on purpose, you fuckin' drunk bastard

Yeah

Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate, girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking pregnant bitch in her stomach with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out or back out
Lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
Flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

Alright?
Yo
What you wanna do?
Y'all want to hear wild?
I see some of y'all gettin' wildWord

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?
He said, Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, Try to fake a stomach ache, it works
I screamed, Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse
What's the matter?
I don't know, my leg, it hurts
Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, You gonna die, honky
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, Look, bitch, what have you done?
Oh my God, I'm sorry, son
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my songWord

Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'mma' sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Ma$e
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'mma' still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No wonder I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?Word

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&amp;M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', Fuck the world like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'Word

Japan, if you know the words, sing it with me

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Shit, I don't know, that's just the way I am (Japan!)
'Cause I am whatever you say I am (Yeah)

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?

We're gonna have a problem here,

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, Yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammalsxe2x80x94well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goesxe2x80x94

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, I don't give a fuck!
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating

Ayo 50
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit, they did it, ha ha

Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

Doesn't take much for me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous
It's a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day, I'm anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking, motherfucker, this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
Fuck that! It's too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off, I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain when they try to rush him
And lost and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list that just ain't Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back I'll be shooting more than just paintballs
Trust me

Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won

There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass xe2x80x94 where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been Bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot xe2x80x94 fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man xe2x80x94 clack [*click*]

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years xe2x80x94 no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means

Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' xe2x80x94 yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
Someone else, problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you moreWord

(I, I wanna grow up too)
Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?
Here we go!

Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash.
Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass.
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the Mr
Not-Havin'-It, it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: Slim, you're really startin' to upset me.
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
We got a bogey, Marshall, I'm on the way.

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border! Let's Go!
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.
Fuck it, keep goin', no time to waste
Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.
Okay, fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
He couldn't have fell off that hard. Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
What was that? Pet Shop Boys.
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'xe2x80x94Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
Compton! Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!
Stomp him! Switch feet! Stomp him! Switch again!
Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again! (Ahh!)
Damn, He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, CanibitchWord

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, 'cause I don't see either one of us budging

I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be taking too much E

Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we're so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
And I'm not excluding myself
'Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

Get at me, dog
HollaWord

Good morning! Ha ha!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well, come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get past these little piss ants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's scrap and then it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
I'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy &amp; Proof, are you with me?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

They consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
In a party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs, I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs, they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death project, you stop breathin'
You die quicker than Mach speed without bleedin'
It ain't about what you readin'
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
You niggas need an 'E' just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

I heard you niggas don't like us but so what?
This beef is like What the fuck did he say in his rap, Em?
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!
What! I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, c'mon!

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you seriously, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at Gs
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morningWord

[Eminem and Hailie:]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids

Ah-ha! Yeah! C'mon!
G-g-g-g G-Unit! Hailie
What?
Come here baby, bring daddy his Oscar
OK
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass!

[Swift:]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, 'cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, 'cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Obie Trice:]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&amp;B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday, how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, Reenact him, you go platinum!
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Eminem:]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Kuniva:]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Proof:]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Kon Artis:]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Eminem:]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life,
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Obie Trice:]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Hailie and Eminem:]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same sizeWord

Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, it's good

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My great aunt and uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
Haha

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know but it feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

I said, father, please forgive me for I know not what I do

Oh!

Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go
Detroit!Word

There's not much you could do or say to faze me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enoughWord

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you will to be
Saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
Move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better

All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well-known tracks

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke
And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows
At Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, White boys don't know how to rhyme.
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but man, goddamn, they flew
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice Lamb suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X-Clan debut
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
Exist in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at You ain't even half black.
You ain't 'posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull her
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the Ole Foolish Pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize
I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe

So let's go back

Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!
Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!
You son of a bitch!Word

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can't handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over T.V. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash him! Mash on him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiersWord

I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'ma whip someone's ass
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?Word

There I go, thinking of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars this ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shit)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die, ho
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Die)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (Ack)
What else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Ah, damn!
Fucking bitchWord

Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away [*slam*]
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe

Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it ,blblblblblblblb, wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?

Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em

All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!

Yeah, yeah

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line on any fences
If so to what extent
If at any should I go
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other peoples' expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, but I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip-ass canister
Goddammit Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom
I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

Or no brain, nice to meet you

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean mean man

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot

I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
Pippity ga-ga poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
OK, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now I (shit) I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, OK?
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on truth serum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurities!

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

You are just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're
Just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Fuck off my dick!Word

Aye yo Paul, It's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'
Wow, well I'll show him who's really 'bad'
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop 'til I get enough'
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking die!
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I can't
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry
Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message fucker
Oh, and by the way
No I don't have a new gun [click] (goddamn it)Word

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
OK

Shady's back

Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop!,..Pajama time

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's OK! [*fart sound*]
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
[Dr Dre] Man, you must be up out your mind
DRE! (AH-AH)

Oh baby

Oh baby, baby
(AH-AH)

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, Save it, boy we got you on tape
yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body!'

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!

Skinny girls

Tall girls
Small girls

Butt squeezin' it's the season

What the fuck is wrong with you?Word

If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type, I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
That's how we go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Tryna play slick thinkin' I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? No!

Em introduced us, 50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mineWord

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)Word

Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy.

I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy,
The way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit.

'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attracting us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.

Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.

But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby,
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.

Like a devil in disguise,
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices
Out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty-four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes
Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy sexy cool,

Chilling you play your position
You never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine.

I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign.

Or maybe you did
Maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on you

You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap.

You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do.

You provide me the lighter fluid
You're fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply
Gas, the match and igniter.

The only way that I am able
To stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face.

But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage.

But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be.

You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alaina to my Hailie.

You are the word that I'm looking for when
I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind.

You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half,
The wife who never divorced me.

You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me.

And no matter how much
Too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on you

That's why I left this snow biz and got into show biz

Bowlish way in Lebanon know 50 the bomb

I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This word is bond, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war now that my money long
Why you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize

While I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters
Ya'll should hate the game not the players, come on

To try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love
Now what you think you chump me if I let you bump me

And in the crack game I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunchtime I start hitting 'em hard with punchlines
You cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro
Plus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock the take for Christ sakes

Yo, son remember them fake players who try to play us
At The Shark Club in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers and beat up gators
Looking like last year's players
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo
From the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding
(Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since '81
They ain't here on a hunt for food
So they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

I change places to prevent catching the cases
Races in the faces tie like shoelaces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this

Yo, you know what I want?
I want the beat to drop in, right, like, now
Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy
I ain't crazy – you are crazy – at least I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot you hot, but you crazy
Why they wanna? I don't know

It's the money that makes shit get ugly
It's the money that makes these hoes love me
It's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me
Man, I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do and see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
And if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read "I Tried" and from the start
Everything I wrote was from my heart
So it's always gon' be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game

They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up
If it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup
If you gossiping about me shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
When getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is give me the cash
Forget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass
Be a good boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright, run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash

They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

I know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real cause after I drop
I'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop
To each his own. Me? I'd get it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat
Give me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat
You're a generous guy, take 'em off or die
Man, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high?
See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye

They say the good die young

Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

Gimme ten minutes, if I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so, word up
Aiyyo, what's up what's up, man
This is what y'all niggas is workin' with for 22 cents a gram?

Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I can go Uptown and get this shit 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
Got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter with ya man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get-this-money shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DEA I sold dope in VA
My coupe stay in Queens but the plates read VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it ain't hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on consignment
(Hey, times is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'mma kill Guiliani
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

NY ain't the same, it's OT player
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

NY ain't the same, it's OT player
You can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
Hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
I'm 'bout my money man, I'm 'bout my money man

Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's OK
'Cause I don't like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, bow! What up, homie?
Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me

I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracs
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah!)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo!)

Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line

Y'all niggas don't want no part of me
You tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on a late night
Pop shots with the fifth and slide off in the six

I'm not a marksman while sparking, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "he say, she say" shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blat!)
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear ya block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, "Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em"
"You heard that shit?" "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You're just a small player in this game, play your part, son

Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line

These cats always escape reality when they rhyme (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah!)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, paw
See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa (Hahaha)
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P 'til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo!)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that can kill you in eight bars
50, um, Jay-Z and Nas
I'm 'a say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me, nigga! What!

Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line

Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
You tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on a late night
Pop shots with the fifth and slide off in the six

How you gonna take this? Like a man or a bitch?
You gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
Man, I stack chips and I unload clips
After 3 summers in the jail I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
You know me, started sellin' leak in the yard
Yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
Big as hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
Damn dog, you been in here that long?
You could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
A convo is only three words, "yo what up"
You ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
And you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After witnesses disappear on the strength of they team
I'm hard as hell to get along with so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in Bible paper - blowin' the lah
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now?
If I catch you going to sick call I'm'a ox you down
Niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
In here a gemstar is like a nine milli chrome
It's similar, in fact they'll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home

You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
Rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
You only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas juxed you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
You ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
Niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

You'd call me animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation
When I walk by, niggas like "Fifty don't play son"
"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga,"
Max out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock
Bust a U-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
The things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
Down goes the window, out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet
Some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
Some get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max
Nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
It's extortion, it happens in the hood often
Claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'Cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
That 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
See the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
Ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
Leave with your blood on my mink in the drop six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
Since '86 my whole clique pop Criss

5-5-1 Brrraaat brrraaat
1-3-4 Brrraaat brrraaat
What the fuck you know about that?

Money make a pimp, pimp hoes
Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what?
Money make the world go round as the world turns
Money make the world go round as the world turns

Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game
Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame
TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroin
50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range
Run away with ya Rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin' chain
Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playing
Better understand what I'm saying what I'm saying, I ain't playing
I'll be in front of your crib, laying, with the Mac to start spraying
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain
That ho loose as hell, you better crack the whip, mang

A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no motherfuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A player ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

I live life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nothing to lose, everything to gain
Either you with me or against me man ain't nothing change
Nigga, you, go against the grain, I'll make you, walk with a cane
Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down with a gang
O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang
You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes
Ayo the bitch used to bring you dough, used to be your bottom ho
Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go
Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with the willies the real shot callers

[Bun B:]
I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guiding me
Haters trying me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me
King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me
Representing sure tasters, the yay' keep taking pride in me
Streets Disciple slide-in me, status reports the badest
You caught walk in the black top with fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back
Tore 'em up, get 'em ready to port, put 'em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimping
If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent
My nigga, live in trife, and that's real, talking shit on us
That's like pulling out a knife and don't kill, that's on the Trill
I'm on for million with your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you
Without you even knowing got you stripping and even hoeing
You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showing

A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no motherfuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch

Running from pimping, bitch you need to run to some pimping
With them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho
You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucker here, huh bitch?
How you gonna catch some dates looking like that ho?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimping bitch!

No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lie wide awake
to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? 3x
Heartbeat, a heart beat
I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? 3x
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? (Heartbeat, a heartbeat)

Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
You say you're wrong, you're wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Okay, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night, oh
The quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So, let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
Ooooooh, this hurricane 3x

But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your black berry down
People is around you
Ill put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you

If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric
Tryna live a new life (woo) so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with, look, yeah
′Cause they want me to lose, they ain't part of the Woos
I been trying so hard not to move reckless

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
Flexing with the business trip
Going cray, take some G6 (ah)
Lit, lit, '76
Even spinning this then they′ll have to
Change his-his-his-
-Iggas trip, trip, trip, this, this
This, this, this, this
You still on this list, list, list, list
I′m off the grid, grid, grid, grid
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid

First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doing no interview
Mask on my face, you can′t see what I finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don′t wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain′t finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad just ′cause I don′t wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm living through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle

Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the low and then that′s what I send it to
I was forgetting you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want, and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?

I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that′s my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell ′em "sorry", they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't delivering Heavenly messages just for the hell of it

Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God everyday, that′s my bestie
They playing soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me as soon she met me
We both got it bad, mama, bag is more heavy
We have to stop counting, it′s getting too petty

You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how he bless me
He wait ′til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get ′em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid-kid-kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

Pray for what folks them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off his list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-a-adam could never be bla-a-ack
′Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, ribTake what you want
Take everything
Take what you wantTake what you want

Better that I change my number, so you can′t explain

Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I′m with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin′ home"
Not me with all of these sins, casting stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)

Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
′Fore you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think pre-cents
I can′t be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you

Look at new scenes, I opened my life, I'm subject to memes
I signed a few -, I polished their dreams
An angel on Earth, come under my wing
Stop running your publishers-
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y′all treat your Lord and Savior like renters′ insurance
You know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom, I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows

I channeled them bad, all in abode
I challenge the trust, I challenge the turbulence
I came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let′s get-
I just get right, huh
Let's get right, let′s get right, let's get right, shh, shh
Ain′t on sight, it's on sight

Ayy, all of my n-as on Channel 5
I don′t channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my uncle′s spaghetti
Been toting totes since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse out the day

I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people serving no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Doing it for all the ones dying
I wanna do it for all the ones crying
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huhMy soul cries out, "Hallelujah"
And I thank God for saving me
I, I thank God
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you′re pinned (I thank God)
Uncle, now he back in the pen'
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

Don′t you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feeling low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest ′fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark ′fore I'm gone
I don′t wanna die alone, I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
Mad when she home, sad when she gone
(Lose it right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floating on a silver lining (in the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, riding on a silver lining
And my God won′t deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
All the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me
(Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, hallelujah, hallelujah)

Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life, make it all come to life
Praying for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon′ come tonight

Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Took your thoughts and penciled ′em in
Should′ve wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they′d come to life
And maybe they'd come to life

Sadness setting in again
Three, two, one, you′re pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me, how auntie been?
Thoughts, you had penciled ′em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they′d come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Bought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I′m free
Floating on a silver lining, floating on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I′m free(Yo) yo (check our situation), yo
My men and my women
(Yo) yo (check our situation), yoMy men and my wom-

You need something unexpected (yo, yo), some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected (yo, yo), and still feel protected
Just one time for the record (yo, yo), just one time for the record
Don′t agree with the message (yo, yo), don't agree with the methods

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Man, it's too early
What the hell you doing waking me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play something that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don′t want my mind alerting
People saying tweeting gonna make you die early
How ′bout have my heart hurting?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early

Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
Have these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo
Nail me to the cross with long nails like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo

I ain′t got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there′s a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don′t have to know
I ain't never question what you was asking for
I gave you every single thing you was asking for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off

I be going through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad′d know
Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes
Things I cried about I found laughable
Lil′ baby Jesus ain't laughing, no
Don′t involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain′t laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain′t have to know

Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

Don't let, don′t let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Okay, I didn′t throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but she didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who′s more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn′t I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we′re in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughing at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain′t against the wall (the wall,)

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (right on, right on)
One last sparkle to followNo child left behind
No child left behind
No child left behindNo child left behind
No child left behind

Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y′all, never count on y'all
Always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y′all, never count on y'all
Always count on Godㅤ

Junya wanna have me on my wrist (wri′, wri', wri′)
Move out of the way of my release (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tryna get me off my Qs and Ps (yeah, yeah, yeah, watch it)
Why can't losers never lose in peace? (Yeah, yeah, watch it)
Ain't nobody ′round me losing sleep
Better find God ′fore He find me
Tell the Devil, "Good night, go to sleep"Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionallyIt is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father
And the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family
And he never has

You know why my spirit′s calling
Darkness can't take light from me
Haven′t you gone far enough?
Sacrificed the ones you love
Gave up on your sanity
Like some twisted fantasy
What would I say to everything
Your actions cost everything

My, my, my family
My family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family
Losing my family

Cried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream
"Why won′t you answer me? I′m in the room"
"Tell mom you're sorry", she′s screaming at me
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"

"Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?"
She don't know what this means, "How′d you become so mean?"
I wish I never screamed, alcohol when you breathe
These things, these things, these things, these things, they sting
"Daddy promise you'll stay, don′t you love me? Love me"

Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family

What did he want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son′s mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different, my son (every time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (today's the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

Laying in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God′s hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I′m doing now is God′s plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

Keep my spirit alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast-food
Bad-had tools and a bad mood
If you don′t turn to a Lil Gotti
They gon' drain all the strength in your lil′ body
They turned me into a Lil Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda, but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon′ make it? Kan', duh

Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don′t do commercials ′cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said, "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I′m 42 and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God′s spiritual ordinance
We know the blacks, the orphans, refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah

Now we′ve been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Sittin' by myself, I′m just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreaming (Jesus)
Man, it′s hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Lord)
I watched so many people leave (Jesus, Lord)
I see ′em change by the season, that's mama′s seasonin'
God got you, the devil′s watchin', he just peekin′ in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I′ve been swimmin′ on the deepest end

It's just drugs, it ain′t no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don′t even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin′ what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good, and just stay focused (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin′ to the hood was like signin′ up for the army
'Cause they been killin′ n-, since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)

You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I′m just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears

And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he′s just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying, ′cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she′s getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid

That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can′t afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it′s finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom

Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin′ numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs ′cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don′t feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side

He seein′ red it's like he′s bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "N-, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn′t send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go ′head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was just the light (Jesus, Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God
The beneficent, the merciful (hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica
It′s Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor (sheesh)
Back from the great beyond, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)

I never rolled the GXSR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana
In Tenochtitlan they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal

The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel′s Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I′m in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It′s like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

I was born to rock a crown, h- yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, n-, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil (you ain't hot)

If I wasn′t rappin′, the calls would stop (haha)
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I pop (Jesus)
F- a car, five houses like, "Look what I copped" (Lord)
Devil like, "Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped"
I don′t say, "What's up?", you basically blocked (facts)
You see it on my head, just know that it′s copped (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I′m from the bottom but Lord knows it's better up top, n-

Yeah, viral pictures (viral), Bible scriptures
One thing about the devil, he's liable to get you (Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don′t count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Jesus) (uh)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin′ (Lord)

He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could′ve did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail

We've been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father′s truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
′Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it's what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein′ locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn′t sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man, I′ve been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I′m a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin′
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven′t been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)Donda, Donda

Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin′ home"
Not me with all of these sins, casting stones

Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus

Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God everyday, that′s my bestie
They playing soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me as soon she met me
We both got it bad, mama, bag is more heavy
We have to stop counting, it′s getting too petty

You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how he bless me
He wait ′til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get ′em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do something wild if I feel like you press me

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid-kid-kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

Pray for what folks them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off his list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-a-adam could never be bla-a-ack
′Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, ribNo matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lie wide awake
to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? 3x
Heartbeat, a heart beat
I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? 3x
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? (Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me? (I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead? (You know I gotta leave, I can't stay)
Or alive to live the lie? (I know I gotta go, I can't)
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
You say you're wrong, you're wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Okay, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night, oh
The quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So, let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God
Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn, let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
Ooooooh, this hurricane 3x
Ooooooh
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to live a lie?
Running away from the light
Running away from the light
Running away to save your lifeThat she wrote, Speech to the Young: Speech to the Progress Toward

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Man, it's too early
What the hell you doing waking me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play something that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don′t want my mind alerting
People saying tweeting gonna make you die early
How ′bout have my heart hurting?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early

Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
Have these n- leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo
Nail me to the cross with long nails like Coco
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo

I ain′t got my point across
'Til we finally get the cross and pass the point
So there′s a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don′t have to know
I ain't never question what you was asking for
I gave you every single thing you was asking for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off

I be going through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad′d know
Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes
Things I cried about I found laughable
Lil′ baby Jesus ain't laughing, no
Don′t involve yourself in things that you ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain′t laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things that you ain′t have to know

Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

Don't let, don′t let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

Okay, I didn′t throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but she didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who′s more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha

You said that I lie, how did I?
I told you everything, didn′t I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we′re in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughing at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain′t against the wall (the wall,)

Don′t let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (right on, right on)
One last sparkle to followDear God, make it alright, only You can make it alright

But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'

And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What did he want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son′s mother
The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different, my son (every time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (today's the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

Is the kingdom (is the kingdom)
And the power (and the power)

Yo, flushed the work just in time and they raided

Screamin′ through the GT roof like "-, we done made it"
Thank God (thank God)
Hundred round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it
Thank God (thank God, brr)

I was facing 15 and I beat it (and I beat it)
Just spent about 20 up at Neimans (up at Neimans)
Did 200 in a demon (in a demon, skrrt)
I′m the illest - and I mean it (and I mean it)
My homie dropping bodies for no reason (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (argh)
Got the baking soda for the remix (remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won′t die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah
Is in his hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

Yeah, don′t hate me 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me ′cause I'm covered in the blood
Laying in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God′s hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I′m doing now is God′s plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

Keep my spirit alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast-food
Bad-had tools and a bad mood
If you don′t turn to a Lil Gotti
They gon' drain all the strength in your lil′ body
They turned me into a Lil Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda, but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon′ make it? Kan', duh

Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don′t do commercials ′cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said, "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I′m 42 and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God′s spiritual ordinance
We know the blacks, the orphans, refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die-ie
Oh-oh-oh, my life, yeah
Is in his hands, so I don′t stress, I pray and strategizeTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now, we′ve been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Sittin' by myself, I′m just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin′
Man, it′s hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus, Lord)
I watched so many people leave
I see 'em change by the season, that′s mama's seasonin′
God got you, the devil's watchin′, he just peekin' in
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I′ve been losin′ all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin′ on the deepest end

It's just drugs, it ain′t no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don′t even know what's upstairs
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what′s up there (Jesus, Lord)
And while I introduce the party, they say it′s up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Then they tell you that you good and just stay focused (Lord)

Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin′ up for the army
'Cause they been killin′ n- since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here

Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reachin′ for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I′m light years ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic

Little boy dies, he′s just one of the mystic
And mama steady cryin' ′cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's gettin′ high and she's gettin' addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That′s a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
16, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can′t afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up

Now she just feelin′ nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she′s still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin′ numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doin' drugs 'cause that′s the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?

From all the pain that been built up, but they don′t feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleedin′ from the side
He seein' red, it′s like he's bleedin′ through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grievin' up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal (Lord)
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill

He gotta show him that it′s that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "N-, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn′t send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I′ve seen everything but Christ"
The big bro just blacked out and all you seein' was the light (Jesus, Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God
The beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringin′ me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin′ through your monitor
Back from the great beyond, the Son of Man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the GXSR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda

Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana
In Tenochtitlan they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Jesus)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal (Lord)
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel

My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I′m in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like light years (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
30 pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It′s a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It′s like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
We've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr.
First and foremost, I wanna thank you
For taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could′ve did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance
We can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know to me it kinda feels like, me, my mother, my brothers
And my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail

We′ve been looked at and treated as criminals, for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society
Is what made him, and it′s what made the children of today
After 25 years of bein′ locked down, 23 and 1
My father has not called any shots
From one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released
Call any of the shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the hell that he has had to live in for the past 26 years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn′t sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that

All my life, man, I′ve been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain′t home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son
He graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn′t hugged
Kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven′t been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)N-, we made it

N-, we made it
N-, we made it

N-, we made it (grr, woo, bah)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
Look, momma, I made it

Look, I remember the days, same fit for a week straight
I used to eat 50-cent cake, now it′s Philippe's
It′s Philippe's for the steak, buy it, I don't care what it cost
And I always keep a pole, I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin′ a woo, we come where you live
Glock 9, infrared, pull up and empty the clip
Dread had the strap all summer in the Floss movin′ reckless
Please do not play with me, n-, I keep a K with me

N-, we made it (grr, woo)
N-, we made it, we made it (woo)
N-, we made it (woo)
Thank God that I made it(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with Your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)I give up on doin′ things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)

When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes, or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can′t hear myself drink

We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at 16, I could barely afford an Audi
How you gonna try to say sometimes it′s not about me
Man, I don′t know what I would do without me

Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time went silence, a luxury
Cussin′ at your baby momma, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin′
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me

Startin' to feel like you ain′t been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
But I guess it′s gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)

Your gun off safety, speak first don′t break me
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord)
Harsh words, you're angry
Lord, don′t take me, oh, oh

(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
Wrap your arms around with your mercy
(Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me)
I give up on doin' things my way
(And tell me everything is going to be alright, Lord) (Wheezy outta here)God is King, we the soldiers
Ultra beam out the solar
When I get to Heaven′s gatesI ain't gotta peak over

Keepin′ perfect composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain′t mean, I′m just focused

Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah

Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday

Won't be in bondage to any man
John 8:33, we the descendants of Abraham
Ye should be made free, John 8:36
To whom the Son set free is free indeed
He saved a wretch like me

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
He is wonderful

If you woke then wake up
With Judas kiss and make up
Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up

Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can′t front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up

Ain't no wantin′, no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty

We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth

Everything old shall now become new
The leaves will be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hooFather I stretch

Stretch my hands to you
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it′s really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don′t even like likes
I was screaming at my Dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screaming at the referee just like Mike
Looking for a bright light, Sigel, "What Your Lifelike"

Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to you)
Pressing on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screaming at my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you′re being like Christ
Only ever seein′ me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searching for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let′s just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light

Driving with my Dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to you)
I′m just tryna find, l've been looking for a new way
I′m just really tryna not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, being on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin′ else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father I stretch)
Wrestlin′ with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it′s really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to you)
Arguing with my Dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

Man

You know, it′s like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all good, then I tried to talk to my Dad (Stretch my hands to you)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin′ on me
I start spazzin' back, he said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
Hold the selfies, put the ′Gram awayGet your family, y'all hold hands and pray

When you get daughters, always keep ′em safe
Watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate

Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A
You're my number one with the lemonade
Raise our sons, train them in the faith
Through temptations, make sure they′re wide awake

Follow Jesus, listen and obey
No more living for the culture, we nobody′s slave

Stand up for my home
Even if I take this walk alone
I bow down to the King upon the throne
My life is His, I'm no longer my own

I pray to God that He′ll strengthen my hand
They will think twice stepping onto my land
I draw the line that's written in the sand
Try me and you will see that I ain′t playin'

Nah, back up off my family, move yo hands
I got my weapons in the Spirit′s land
Ah, Jezebel don't even stand a chance
Jezebel don't even stand a chance

Chick-fil-AHow you get so much favor on your side?
"Accept Him as your Lord and Saviour," I replied
Thou should love thy neighbor, not divideI′ma ride, that's on God

His lights shine the brightest in the dark
Single mothers know they got my heart
And all my brothers locked up on the yard
You can still be anything you wanna be

Went from one in four to one in three
Thirteenth amendment, gotta′ end it, that's on me
He the new commander and the chief
That's on Keef, that′s on God

Before the ranch, I had horses in the garage
When the Forbes cover was just a mirage
They had me chasin′ statues, that's on pride
Oh my God, Bust said, "That′s on Tribe"

When I thought the Book of Job was a job
The Devil had my soul, I can't lie
Life gon′ have some lows and some highs
Before the Grammy's ever gave a nod

I wore my heart on my sleeve, I couldn′t hide
In '03 they told me not to drive
I bleached my hair for every time I could've died
But I survived, that′s on God

I′ve been tellin' y′all since '05
The greatest artist restin′ or alive
That's on L.A. Reid, that′s on Clive
That's no jive, that's on God

Off the 350s, he supplied
The IRS want they fifty plus our tithe
Man, that′s over half of the pie
I felt dry, that′s on God

That's why I charge the prices that I charge
I can′t be out here dancing with the stars
No, I cannot let my family starve
I go hard, that's on GodGod is my light in darkness, oh
God, God is, He
He is my all and all (And I′ll never turn back)God is

Everything that has breath, praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He′s done
He's the strength in this race that I run

Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can′t keep it to myself, I can′t sit here and just be still
Everybody, I will tell to the whole world, it's Him

King of Kings, Lord of Lords
All the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor
All are welcome through the door
You won′t ever be the same
When you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I′m saying
Jesus saved me, now I'm sane

And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision giving me a revelation

This ain′t 'bout a damn religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll

All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let ′em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right
Thank you, Jesus won the fight

That′s what God is
That's what God is
That′s what God isEvery knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord

Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say "don't say this, don't say that"
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you
Premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good
To compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really
Really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum

Some days, some
Smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna someday
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray . no, oh, no
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This now, with good in mind
But maybe some day
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
Oh, once again I am a child

Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me
Don't you grow up in a hurry
Your mom'll be worried
It was all part of the story
Even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory
You will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors

Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off
Niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps,
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters,
Now they precautious
Father forgive me,
I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster
Not havin' menages
I'm just being silly
I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No daddy don't play
Not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress
I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whip her ass, she move in with him
Then he whip her ass
You go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas,
But yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence
Next she'll be off to college
And then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried

[Verse 1: Kelly Price (Choir)]
So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
They don't know, they don't
They don't know, they don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til they drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79

All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good
Momma pass in Hollywood

Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)

Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he, he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.feat. Young Thug

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own you
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
No lie
No lie

You set the night on fire
I'm still gon' be here in the morning
No lie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my, lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
[Hook: The Weeknd]
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I,
[Hook: The Weeknd]
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
I wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
[Outro: Section 25 & Kanye West]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them, throw them away
Oh, life's a feeling
Oh, the body's a feelingReal friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my,
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, hope you good"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
[Verse 1]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago

You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
[Hook]
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
[Verse 2]
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary
Scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
Please, no more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Back in the lab and shit
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
And you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father,)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father,)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(Lord) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
They don't know, they don't
They don't know, they don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til they drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics and spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79

All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good

Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me.
Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he, he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.feat. Young Thug

Oh, the body's a feelingReal friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my,
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, hope you good"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Burned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Knowin', you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
Amongst the yellow eyes

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
[Verse 1]
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ándale Ándale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
[Hook]
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
[Verse 2]
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job
[Hook]
And I drove back 30 hours
[Bridge]
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh

30 hoursLa di da da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La da da da di da da-a, la-a
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary
Scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
Please, no more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasinsIt’s too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)

Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don’t judge ‘em Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, lets keep it bouncin
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the blue spot she try to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in put my dick in her mouth
[Hook]For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment

But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment

Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans

I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted

Soon as they like you make more money like you
But kissing people ass is so unlike youThe only rapper who could compare to Michael
So here's a few hating ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few hating ass niggas who'll bite you

Old niggas mentally still in high school

I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa es su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves

They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation

They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that private owned prison
Get your piece today
They Probably all in the Hamptons

Now what the fuck they gon' say now?feat. Chief Keef & Justin Vernon 
[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
This man can't handle me
But this man can’t handle his weed
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on in Indiana
I'm heard on the radio now
[Hook: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own yah
One more fuck and I can own yah
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow dojaThen her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown yah
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over
And bitch I'm back out my coma

[Outro: Justin Vernon and Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fur
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh on the phoneDamn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water onAnd you turn off your iPhone

Careless whispers, eye fucking, biting ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eating ass
Your pussy′s too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last

Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin′ fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don′t look through the glass

Chasin′ love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

That′s all dem can do (Say wah, say wah)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting, a′ dat man do

Action thing yo' a badman thing

I′m a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn′t try that no day

When we roll ′round 'pon your block
Nuh badda fi say we won′t spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round ′pon your block
Nuh badda fi say we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We agon′ smile 'pon court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J.

Blood on the leaves
[Verse 1]
I just wanna clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah and I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it
[Hook 1]
You could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
It came out of your body
It came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore yah
Before the love life stole yah
Remember we were so young
When I would hold yah
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me
[Bridge]
Something strange is happening
[Hook 2]
You could've been somethin'
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
It came out of our body
It came out of our body
[Verse 2]
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know yah
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
I'll ride for my niggas, I'll die for my niggas
[Verse 3]To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you call me crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant ain't it
That's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
Or that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony
Yeah, yeah she got you homey
'Til death but do your part

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Maybe it's cause
She into Leo's and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's gettin' cold, better bring your ski clothes
Pick it through the keyhole, the door locked by myself
And I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot
Blocka blocka, blocka, blocka blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelin's like Zulu, then nothin' is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big PoppaOn to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka
Ohhh
[Hook]
[Outro: Kid Cudi]
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go
[Hook]feat. King Louie
[Verse 1: King Louie]
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
MOB, she call me selfish
Success got them jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, I'mma break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas had cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' them [?] pain improve
[Hook: King Louie]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This the greatest shit in the club since In Da Club
It's so packed I might ride around
With no bodyguard back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening endWhen I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again
[Hook]
[Outro: Beenie Man]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirtyI know I got a bad reputation
Walkin' 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, yo ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty winin' 'round all these Jamaicans
Ugh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
[Bridge 1: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh huh honey
[Pre-Hook]
Close your eyes and let the world paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can’t get spunk on the mink
I mean damn what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, aye yo we made it, Thanksgiving
So aye, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
[Bridge 2: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
No hiding your love, no hiding, no hiding

Uh huh honeyHuman beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him

 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?

[Kanye West:]

[Kanye West:]
 Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
 That's pig latin, itch-bay

 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for
[Kanye West:]
 Ya'll weed purple, My money purple
 Ya'll Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah,
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again,
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll,)
 Blast for ya (Is now,)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em

Cause im movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
Ay, ay
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?

And i swear the God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes

She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
ay, ay
I'm moving in slow motion, slow motionIt was all good just a week ago
Niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop
Niggas kill themselves what niggas gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas tellin' me "You back?"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe but you can have some more of me
Or G, or are we speakin' methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
You don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga, really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our glow
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God, 'cause you know a nigga just went H.A.M.
Hard As a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM, Hard As a muthafucker

 Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
 That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
 Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
 That's the year I came through
 I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
 Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
 New money, I found the fountain of youth
 I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
 A case of Ace, make it 2, Nigga we rolling, beat the deuce

 So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
 Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
 Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
 Niggas gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
 I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
 Primetime, never hit these heights

 Shit taste different, don't it?
 You know what, you right
 It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
 "When you coming home" That's a text from my wife

 And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
 I mean who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)

The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh)
These are the makings of you
(Whoo)
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are not A&Rs in a cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls, that's way too fine for us to keep off us
(Ah, how)
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to come all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Takin' refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar

Honey suckle lamb

Now when Rome got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
They momma named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your Fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid question's like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessey
And bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy

I used to hear this through the walls in the hood
When I was back on my pajama shit, Afros and marijuana sticks
Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin'
Like the sample that I'm rhymin' with, Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised, I don't needle pop
Takin' sips of pop, six packs of millanips, Pink Champale
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit, I used to balance on a scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get mine up

It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okayHuman beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

No church in the wild

Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I'm never going to jail

Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive

 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 And I'll never let my son have an ego
 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)

[Jay-Z:]
 Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him

 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for?
[Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gon stop me?
 No brakes, I need, State Farm
 So many watches I need 8 arms
 One neck but got 8 charms
[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Kanye West:]
 Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
 That's pig latin, itch-bay
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for
[Kanye West:]
 Ya'll weed purple, My money purple
 Ya'll Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah,
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again,
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll,)
 Blast for ya (Is now,)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause im movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
Ay, ay
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
bullet proof condom, when i'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why?
Fuckin' centerfolds
And i swear the God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
i got my fur on feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
ay, ay
I'm moving in slow motion, slow motionIt was all good just a week ago
Niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop
Niggas kill themselves what niggas gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas tellin' me "You back?"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe but you can have some more of me
Or G, or are we speakin' methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and jigga
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM, Hard As a Muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?

I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga, really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our glow
When my nephew died, daddy dead
Niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots nigga fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God, 'cause you know a nigga just went H.A.M.
Hard As a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM, Hard As a muthafucker
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM*Deluxe Edition Bonus Tracks*

Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls, that's way too fine for us to keep off us
(Ah, how)
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to come all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Takin' refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel

So next time you see me on your Fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid question's like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessey
And bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy

Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin'
Like the sample that I'm rhymin' with, Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised, I don't needle pop
Takin' sips of pop, six packs of millanips, Pink Champale
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit, I used to balance on a scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh

What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?

Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?

Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars

Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause im movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
Ay, ay
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
bullet proof condom, when i'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why?
Fuckin' centerfolds
And i swear the God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
i got my fur on feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we got our his and her on
Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
ay, ay
I'm moving in slow motion, slow motionWe in the time of our lives baby (b-baby)
Turn the music up, Primetime
(b-b-baby, b-b-baby, baby, b-b-baby)
Yeah, Primetime, Beat by Dion, Our third eon
That's what the fk we on
Mo' money, 40 year old phenom
Our 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23's they can't fk with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
That's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fk up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, Nia we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do (ooh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherer, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Nias gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
Sh*t taste different, don't it?
You know what, you right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherer like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherer til I call you back
I mean who says sh*t like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I'll never let ‘em ever hit the telethon

See, I just want ‘im to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want ‘im to be someone people like
Don't want ‘im to be hated, all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
And I'll never let ‘im ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars,

Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Niggas talkin', they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours1985 white lamboghini Countach, 2 of em
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause im movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey

Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell

So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero
A whole lot of O's
What you after, actor money?

Don't look at the jewerly, or get your brrr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglin'
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and I'm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
Til then I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah it's like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga
hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now
ay, ay
I'm moving in slow motion, slow motionWe in the time of our lives baby (b-baby)
Turn the music up, Primetime
(b-b-baby, b-b-baby, baby, b-b-baby)
Yeah, Primetime, Beat by Dion, Our third eon
That's what the fk we on
Mo' money, 40 year old phenom
Our 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23's they can't fk with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88', Got warm in 92', I landed in 96'
That's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fk up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, Nia we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do (ooh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, Coloring out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherer, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Nias gon kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first 1st class flight
I'm trippin' on it, socks on marble floors
I'm slippin' on it, Champagne, I'm sippin' on it
Sh*t taste different, don't it?
You know what, you right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherer like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherer til I call you back
I mean who says sh*t like that, and doesn't laugh (un-huh)
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk you wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what the fk we gon' do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh
(baby, baby, baby)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild[feat. Beyonce]

 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him

 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost

 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball

 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?

[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah,
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again,
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 [Verse 1 - Kanye West]
 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 [Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll,)
 Blast for ya (Is now,)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin' in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin' if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here ballin', I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission'
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody wit'out tellin' me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun comin' up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin' 'bout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbin' the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's somethin' that the pastor don't preach
That's somethin' that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild[feat. Beyonce]

What’s 50 grand to a muhfucka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Y’all don’t know that don’t shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain’t even s’pose to be here,
Ball so hard, since we here
It’s only right that we be fair
Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don’t tick tock
Audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I’m shocked too,
I’m supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what I’ve escaped
You’d be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I’m movin’ the Nets to BK
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna find me
That shit cray
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl ‘fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray (that shit cray), ain’t it Jay?
Ball so hard
What she order (what she order), fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold (whip so cold), this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you’ll never be around muhfuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France (I’m just sayin’)
Prince William’s ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louis my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!
I don't even know what that means.
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not, it's gross
(It gets the people going!)
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna find me
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna find me
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me get in my zone

You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don’t let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me into my zone
I’m definitely in my zoneIt makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't be regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
I invented swag, poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof, I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes
Damn Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, but I'm about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I'm never going to jail
I made Jesus Walks, so I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I'm done I'll hit you up maña, nah!
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana's with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we digging tunnels
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker reads: "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chilling, Ye is chilling
What more can I say? We killing 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lames
Lord please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne[Kanye West:]

 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)
 (For me, for me)
 (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
 And I'll never let my son have an ego
 He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
 I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
 So everybody know he love white people
 And I'll never let 'em leave his college girlfriend
 And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
 And I'll never let 'em ever hit the telethon
 I mean even if people dyin' and the world ends
 See, I just want 'I'm to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
 Just want 'I'm to be someone people like
 Don't want 'I'm to be hated, all the time judged
 Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
 And I'll never let 'I'm ever hit a strip club
 I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
 And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
 Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)
 (It's a new life for me)

 Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
 (And I'm feelin' good)
[Jay-Z:]
 Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
 'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
 Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
 I just wanna take ya to a barber
 Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
 Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
 Took me 26 years to find my path
 My only job is cuttin' the time in half
 So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
 Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
 Look a man dead in his eyes
 So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
 And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
 I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
 Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
 Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
 Never repeat him, never repeat him
 (Sun in the sky)
 (You know how I feel)
 (Breeze driftin' on by)

 Welcome to the jungle
 Welcome to the jungle well [x2]
[Kanye West:]
 I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
 She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
[Jay-Z:]
 Black Axl Rose, Move halfs and wholes
 Come down to the jungle, Just ask for Hov
 Move blocks and squares, Move apples and pears
 Work pots and pans, Just to cop me some Airs
 My uncle died, My Daddy did too
 Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
 My nephew gone, My heart is torn
 Sometimes I look to the sky, Ask why I was born
 My faith in God, Every day is hard
 Every night is worse, That's why I pray so hard
[Kanye West:]
 Why I pray so hard, This is crazy God
 Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
 So que sera, Get a case of Syrah
 Let it chase the pain, Before it goes too far
[Jay-Z:]
 My dreams is big, Reality set in
 Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
 Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
 Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
 I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
 Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
 I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
 I ball at the mall, Beginning of the ending
 Where the fuck is the sun?
 It's been a while, Momma, look at ya son
 What happened to my smile?
 My tears is tatted My rag in my pocket
 I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
 Champagne for the pain, Weed for the low
 God damn I'm so high, Where the fuck did I go?
 I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
 I look in the mirror, My only opponent
 Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
 Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
 No crying in public, Just lying to judges
 Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well
[Swizz:]
 Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
 Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?

[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads

 Last night ain't go so well
 Got kicked up out the hotel
 Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
 Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
 You just a commentator, If you getting paper
 Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
 In some relations, You just supposed to say none
 Heard she fucked the doorman
 Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
 Heard Yeezy was racist, Well, I guess that's on one basis
 I only like green faces
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?

 I wrote the verse, That I hope will hurt you
[Jay-Z:]
 Who gone stop me huh?
 Beat the odds, Best the Feds
 It wouldn't be wise, To bet against the kid
 Start me broke, I bet I get rich
 Night shift, 6 to 6
 Gimmie one shot, One pot
 I'll show up in all white, Wearing no socks
 No ceiling, New coupe
 They know I'm a dope boy
 They don't have no proof
 I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
 It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
 I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
 I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
 Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
 I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
 I'm throwed And I stuck to the G-code,
 I'm here, Oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
 Ok here, Like a hare, Like a rabbit, I like karats
 I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
 Like broke, Like nope, Like ha,
 I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
 Like nope, Like nope
 To the beat Noah,
 2 seats in the 911 No limit on the black card
 Told ya'll I was gonna go HAM, To the ocean was my backyard
 No lies in my verses, Please pardon all the curses
 Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
 Middle finger to my old life, Special shout out to my old head
 If it wasn't for your advice, A nigga would have been so dead
 I'm living life, Til these niggas kill me
 Turn this up, If these niggas feel me
 I'm riding dirty, Trying to get filthy
 Pabalo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
 Graduated to the MOMA
 And I did all of this, Without a diploma
 Graduated from the corner
 Ya'll can play me
 For a motherfuckin fool if you wanna,
 Street smart, And I'm book smart
 Could have been a chemist, Cause I cook smart
 Only thing that can stop me is me, And I'm a stop when the hook start
 Hold up
[Kanye West:]
 This is something like the Holocaust
 Millions of our people lost
 Bow our heads and pray to the lord
 Til I die, I'm a fuckin ball
 Now who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
 Who gon stop me?
 Who gon stop me huh?
[Jay-Z:]
 Black cards, black cars
 Black on black, black broads
 Whole lotta money in a black bag
 Black strap, you know what that's for[Jay-Z:]
 Bloody Murder, murder murder [x4]
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder
[Jay-Z:]
 This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
 Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
 Strays from the same shade, Ni**a we on the same team
 Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
 All black everything, Ni**a you know my fresh code
 I'm out here fightin' for you, Don't increase my stress load
 Ni**as watchin' the throne, Very happy to be
 Power to the people, When you see me, see you
[Kanye West:]
 And I'm from the murder capital, Where they murder for capital
 Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
 Lookin' at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
 No shop class but half the school got a tool,
 And I could die any day type attitude
 Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
 It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
 41 souls murdered in 50 hours
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder,
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
 Murder again,
 Is it genocide?
 Cause I can still hear his momma cry, Know the family traumatized
 Shots left holes in his face, Bout piranha-size
 The old pastor closed the cold casket
 And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
 It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
 I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
 314 soldiers died in Iraq
 509 died in Chicago
[Jay-Z:]
 I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
 Real niggas just multiply
 And they say 21 I was supposed to die
 So I'm out here celebratin' my post demise
 If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
 You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
 What up blood? What up cause?
 It's all black, I love us
[Kanye West:]
 The paper read murder, Black on black murder again
[Jay-Z:]
 It's a celebration of black excellence
 Black tie, black Maybachs
 Black excellence, opulence, decadence
 Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
 I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
 In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
 Do you know who I am Clarice?
 No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
 Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
 The new black elite They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
 I repeat, My religion is the beat
 My verse is like church, My Jesus piece Now please, domino, domino
 Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
 What's up to Will, Shoutout to O
 That ain't enough, We gon need a million more
 Kick in the door, Biggie flow
 I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
[Kanye West:]
 Yea it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
 So we won't take the time out til we reach the T O P
 From paroles to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
 We like the promised land of the OG's
 In the past if you picture events like a black tie
 What the last thing you expect to see, black guys
 What's the life expectancy for black guys?
 The system's working effectively, that's why
 I'll be a real man and take care of your son
 Every problem you had before this day is now done
 New crib, watch a movie
 Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
 Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
 Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
 Sunday morning, Praise the Lord
 You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
 So let's savor this moment, And take it to the floor
 Black excellence, Truly yours[Hook - Frank Ocean]

 [Verse 1 - Kanye West]
 I told my mama I was on the come up
 She said “you going to school I’ll give you a summer”
 Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
 10 years later she driving a Hummer
 N*ggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
 What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
 And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
 I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
 Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
 Started a little blog just to get some traffic
 Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
 A million hits and the web crashes – damn!
 South Park had ’em all laughing
 Now all my n*ggas designing and we all swaggin’
 Ignore the critics just to say we did it
 This ain’t no fashion show, motherf*cker, we live it

 I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
 For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
 Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
 Straight out the kitchen, shh don’t wake Nana!
 Built a republic, that still stands
 I’m trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man’s
 Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
 The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
 Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up YaYa?
 What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some aqua
 No papa, bad Santa
 The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
 I got my liberty, chopping grams up
 Street justice, I pray God understand us
 I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
 This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 Oooooh
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z:]
 Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
 Rome was burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
 Why does it always end up like this?
 Something that we don't determine
 Same people that I fought for
 That I fight for, that I ride for
 That I live for, that I die for
 Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
 And they want me dead
 But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you
 But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
 We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
 Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
 When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
 I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
 And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
 So the love is gone, Til blood is drawn
 So we no longer wear the same uniform
 Fuck you squares, The circle got smaller
 The castle got bigger, The walls got taller
 And truth be told after all that said
 Niggas still got love for you
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Showed love to you niggas
 You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
 I picked up the pieces, Before you swept on it
 God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it
 Shit feelin' like death don't it
 Charge it to the game, Whatever's left on it
 I spent about a minute, Maybe less on it
 Fly pelican fly, Turn the jets on it
 But first I shall digress on it
 Wasn't I a good king?
 (Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
 Didn't I spoil you?, Me or the money, what you loyal to?
 (Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
 Made you Royalty and royalties
 (Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
 And this is how niggas rewardin me
 (Damn)
[Chorus: Mr Hudson]
 I love you so
 But why I love you
 I'll never know [x4]
[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
 Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
 But I'm bullet proof, bitch you can't get nothin' past me
 Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
 And I'm bussin' back, So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones What do you do when the love turns the hate?
 (Gotta separate from these fuckin fakes)
 Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist
 So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
 Am I my brother's keeper?
 (Only if that nigga don't creep up)
 Got a pistol under my pillow
 (I've never been a deep sleeper)
 P-p-p-paranoia
 (Cause the nigga that said he'll,)
 Blast for ya (Is now,)
 Blastin for ya, That's an assassin for ya
 (These niggas got a shot they'll shoot)
 Please lord (Forgive him)
 For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

See, I just want ‘im to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want ‘im to be someone people like
Don't want ‘im to be hated, all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge
And I'll never let ‘im ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

Sins of a father make yo' life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

(Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel)Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Niggas talkin', they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yoursHuman beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the colloseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving, the sky's a feast
Rolling in the new rolls royce corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin' from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleahced
Drug dealer chic
Wonderin' if a dove's prayers reach
It's pious Pius, the God loves Pius
Socrates asks, "Whose bias do y'all seek?"
Or for Plato, the screech
I'm out chere ballin', I know you hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
You let me in to your encryption
Yeah, yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that Jungle Fever
You will not the threesom
Just roll the weed up till I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never Fck no-one without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad, Real
Sun coming up 5AM
I Wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking about the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tatoos: One read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is cursed by Monogamy"
It's something the pastor don't preach
It's something the teacher can't teach
When we die, The money can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-beliver, who don't belive in anything?
We'll make it out alive
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttin' the time in half
So at 13 we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

(Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel)Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
She turned around and looked at me and said "alive"
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Black Axl Rose
Move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle
Just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares
Move apples and pears
Work pots and pans
Just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died
My Daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain
I can barely move
My nephew gone
My heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky
Ask why I was born
My faith in God
Every day is hard
Every night is worse
That's why I pray so hard
Why I pray so hard
This is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything
I lost it all
So que sera
Get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain
Before it goes too far
My dreams is big
Reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door
It died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard
I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul
I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep
I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall
Beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while
Momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted
My rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love
I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain
Weed for the low
God damn I'm so high
Where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself
I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror
My only opponent
Where the fuck is the press?
Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care
I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public
Just lying to judges
Risking my life
I'm already dying, so fuck it well
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Niggas talkin', they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well that's cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldn't be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy
They don't have no proof
I'm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like, I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, I'm expecting heaven, I'm owed,
I'm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ain't no joke, I can't be stopped
Like nope, like nope
Extend the beat Noah…
2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told y'all I was gonna go HAM, til' the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasn't for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
I'm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and I'm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And I'ma stop when the start
Hold up
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me huh?
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
EndBloody murder, murder, murder
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All-black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stressload!
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like "damn! I was just with him after school"
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot repping his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine black power
41 souls murdered in fifty hours
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his mama cry
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uh, real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You're gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? What up, cuz? It's all black, I love us
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder"
Paper read "murder, black-on-black murder" again
It's a celebration of black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shout out to O
That ain't enough. we gonna need a million more
"Kick in the door" Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees to hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see, black guys?
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why!
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You're the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yoursYou might think you've peeked the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
It may just sound all whack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fucking Yeezy in Serrato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a nice flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the king of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why you're Winslow
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
I saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohAin't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off a this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said: "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I know cops, hems is lifting lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Break up the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downI'm living' in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
And then they (hey) and then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Colin, Powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
Now this would be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window
Letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?
(21st century schizoid man)[Instrumental]Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
All of the lights
If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm headed home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university
All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts suck me dry, I spent that bread
She need a daddy , baby please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We're going all the way this time
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this

You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh

I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh, ohI shoot the lights out
Until it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker, now looks who's in trouble
As you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
The best living or dead, hands down, huh?
Less talk, more head right now, huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And about to take it to another level, bitch
None of who you goin' get, ain't nobody as cold as this
Do the rap and attract triple double no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same rap's will the track, man
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act
And short nigga but these ho's love my accent
She came up to me and said this the number two gal
If you want to make it number one, you're number two now
This the Goose and Malibu, I call it MaliBOO-YAH
God damn Yeezy, how you gonna hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Not gonna do us, it's new now
Think you motherfucker really, really  need to cool out
'Cause you will never get on top of this
So mami best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claimin' that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want to swallow shit
I'm livin' in the future so the presence is my past
My presence is the present, kiss my ass
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert

Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscious
Question: what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conga, stomp, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear things scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill a block, I murder the avenues
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get are these vampires and blood suckers
All I see are these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelin's in the air
All I see are these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryin' to draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards off
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'mma need to see your fuckin' hands
Pull up in a monster automobile gangster
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You can be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first thing's first: I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
He a dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppie heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the Rasta and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with a funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my show's ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a Middle-Eastern climate, violent
Twenty matahran, go teewyin' it, wile it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
'Cause all these niggas so one-track minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki sh-she escaped
She on a diet, but her cock is eating cheesecake
And I'll say "Bride of Chuckie" is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Jay should menage Friday
Pink wig, dick, ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, home
I, I crossed the line, line
And I'll, I'll let God decide-cide
I, I wouldn't last these shoulders
So I, I am headed home, homeOne hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all love us, I need more rubbers
And If I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, ta-dah
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man they outta work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit something that gotta purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have installed
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die, you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's
The Hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil' so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I've become
CNN said I'll be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them ho's coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilo's came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places, the favorite
My cup overruneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn it's hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment: thou should not hate, kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothin' like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march
Damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the two's nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the path finder
'Cause you haters got PhD's
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron
Hey yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous

Cars for the misses and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculousI love it though
I love it though
You know
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waitin'
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us, may the God's be with us
And that magic hour I seen good Christians make rash decisions
Oh she do it, what happened to religion?
Oh she lose it, she putting on her make up
She casually allure, text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a Jumbotron
I'm lookin' at her like, "This what you really want it, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh, I forgot it's summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waitin'
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standin' there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said, "You are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme
That's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evenin'
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' RosÃ© all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes Sedan, they'll export
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my stepsAnd I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my dick.
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit.
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
See, I always find
And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off

I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, huh?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Fools like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you've got another advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'm a manage,
If one day you just up and leave
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you canI think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Bittersweet taste made his gold tooth ache, uh
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun come, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won a sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh?
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You can hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gang bang
It's kinda crazy, that's opposite of the same thing
Well, I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same game
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaid
She wanna role play 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll dolja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
Especially if she can't get that dress on Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her get away
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck wit' the lights on?
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Fuck with the lights, fuck with the, with the lights on
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby, we'll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a lifeWhose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it, like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
'TIl about two am and I call back and I hang up
And I start to blame myself, somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking, and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you
Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy, I ain't your right, girl
You'll probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity, we erased one another
So far from where we came with so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy
Equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
Oh, my God, baby, you done took this shit to the 'nother motherfucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me
Ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this

Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga? Yeezy taught me
You never used to talk dirty, but now you, you god damn disgusting
My, my God, wh-wh-where'd you learn that? Yeezy taught me
Look at you motherfucking butt-ass naked

Who thought you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choo's on?
Yeezy taught me

And I, I, I, I love it, and I thank you
I thank you, my dick thanks you
How did you learn, how di-
How did your pussy game come up?
Yeezy taught me
I was fucking parts of your pussy
I never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before"
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga I'ma thank him

I'ma shoot a bootlegger, that's how good I feel about this nigga
Oh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker's the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel, this is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source, I remember
Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught me
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you wellI'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
Says she's down for the night
I'm never alone
Down the time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Mama say, mama say, mama Maku-san
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in that afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah
I'm up in the woods
  (Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm down on my mind
  (Run for your life)
I'm new in the city
  (Down for the night, down for the night)
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
Down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the nightUs living as we do upside-down
And the new words at hand is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preachers spill or squeal
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly peaked
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up
Woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped from bed
And we have not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed
Across our authentic vagina
We learned to our amazement
The untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in a rusty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, freedom
Democracy, liberty and justice
Were revolutionary code names
That proceeded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no (EXPLICIT) Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy,?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town (EXPLICIT) with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much (EXPLICIT), I woke up in Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohAin't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my (EXPLICIT) get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a (EXPLICIT) ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this (EXPLICIT)
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest (EXPLICIT), I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a (EXPLICIT) roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in (EXPLICIT) coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my (EXPLICIT), x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack (EXPLICIT)
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a (EXPLICIT) about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black (EXPLICIT)
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, (EXPLICIT)
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
(EXPLICIT) hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downLetra - Power - Kanye West
Im livin in the 21st century
Doin something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We aint got nothin to lose, maf-cka, we rollin
Huh? Maf-cka, we rollin
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white mans world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin
Huh? I see you in the mornin
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours
And then they (Go)

F-ck SNL and the whole cast
Tell em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
Im an asshole? You n-ggas gotÂ jokes
You short-minded n-ggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, f-ckin gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child, Im fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
N-gga, no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours
And then they (Go)

If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks

I met this girl on Valentine's Day, (EXPLICIT) her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march

The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a lifeUs living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault,
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no (EXPLICIT) Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy,?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town (EXPLICIT) with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much (EXPLICIT), I woke up in Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohAin't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my (EXPLICIT) get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a (EXPLICIT) ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this (EXPLICIT)
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest (EXPLICIT), I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a (EXPLICIT) roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in (EXPLICIT) coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my (EXPLICIT), x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack (EXPLICIT)
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a (EXPLICIT) about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black (EXPLICIT)
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, (EXPLICIT)
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
(EXPLICIT) hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, downLetra - Power - Kanye West
Im livin in the 21st century
Doin something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open

You short-minded n-ggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, f-ckin gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child, Im fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
N-gga, no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, f-ck that, the Worlds ours

That's one hell of a lifeUs living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault,
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.

Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce Gs like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows

Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, trying to escape my trouble
Kids stop they're greeting me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursing the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around

But on the con-trilli, I packs the MAC-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathing soft on him
What's ya name?

Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra (uh)
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Trying to push 700s, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too

Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White!
Need the keys to your InnKeeper (That's right)
Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me

Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues (What the fuck?)

Ah, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga loving his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is bugging my life
Hospital days, reflecting when my man laid up
On the uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slipping, this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we living, just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said, Pray for me.
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothing but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinking Mai-Tais, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, ha ha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spending money from '88, what?

Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're copping me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shining brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is biting
J-A-Y hyphen, controlling, manipulating
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swinging for the fence

Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners

Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it

Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mamma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, I can't die, I can't die

This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're saying too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked, that's life, I live it
Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Picking their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doing sticks
Like, Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, Mamma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys, making Gs, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?

(Yo! Start the show! Start the show!)
Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that little tape of yours, and it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a little freestyle
Put that champagne down, and kick a little freestyle for me tonight

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone, check this out

Too much West Coast dick licking
And too many niggas on a mission, doing your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes

Hah, what the fuck
That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nah mean?
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?

Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone, yo, yo, yo

Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggas clocking my spending
Exercising your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screaming your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feeling sarcastic, Look at him, still sleeping
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinking longevity until I'm seventy
Living heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?

Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track (aight)
Now this is coming on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96?
(No doubt, no doubt)
Well, it is definitely the bomb! But you know I do wanna say something to you, I know you've been having a lot of problems with the law
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!
(Hah, thanks a lot)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly
(Hey, shut the fuck up!)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the F up? Who told me to shut the F up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was saying, we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies going like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got this, put our own money in our businessesnrnYeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to something epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From selling 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, getting my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughing hard, happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illing for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas

Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of getting cream
Let's do this, it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS xe2x80x94 you see me stressed, right?

Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?nrnFox Brown
Yeah, Jay-Z, what
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You got your own '96 something to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they're conniving
Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas
From the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my afterlife
Laughing, my shit is tight, who you asking, right?

Ain't no nigga like the one I got

Man of their own, man of their own)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fresh to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag
Looking half black and Filipino, faking no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joan &amp; David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove, but love
You know these hoes be making me weak
Y'all knows how it goes, B, and so I creep
I've been sinning since you been playing with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps them grinning
So I run way the fuck up in 'em
And wrinkle their face like linen
I play hard until they say God
He's keeping it real, Jigga stay hard.
Lord, don't even trip, shit, I never slip
Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill

Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But, love, you know these hoes be making me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep

What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the French tubs
Macking this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you, basically made you
Into a don, flipping weight, her-on and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringing bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscing
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sipping Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you fronting in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Ballys
Now all your mens is up in your Benzes
High post, I swear you be killing me, playing inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spending that bitch
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay piling
How you living large on the island?
All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was coming off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holding this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushing hundred-thousand-dollar cars

Friend or foe, yo, state your biz
Um mm, you tending dough? Ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like nobody coming around here fucking with their dough for shit
You enterprising though, and I like it
But fuck with the big dogs, yo, I gotta bite ya
Look, it's out of my hands
And you getting money 'round here, it's not in the plans
So hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas
I'm sending niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is
Let me guess, they said it was money 'round here
And the rest is me stopping you from getting it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
Now please give me the room key
You're twitching, don't do that, you making me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers
So please, would you put your hand back in sight?
They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picassoxe2x80x94you know, the best
'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me, son
I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys
'Cause I'm finding it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave
I guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys
And a promise you never, no matter the weather
Ever ever ever ever ever ever come around here no mo', ha ha hanrnCome experience life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
Actions: well, y'all know the actions

Uh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
To honies hawking, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
Nobody want to be like Michael where I'm from
Just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cold green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing 'vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium
And stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)

Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Hahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Let's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga
Here's a thou, A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly (and then you blow!)
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break 'em for nobody
Hah, I like your rxc3xa9sumxc3xa9, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)

It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up ( and stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)nrnHah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sure money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)

Uh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga, Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wine down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc', I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard

Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
Cashmere baby
(Motherfucking pimp that's what he be)
Cashmere baby
(It don't get no hotter than that baby)
Sure you're right, sure you're right
(Them niggas know)

Check it out, check it out
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The star player, the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sure you're right
I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight?
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick: look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good footn
Aye, Purse, rack 'em up, man
What you betting, Biggs?
Bet the same thing
Ay, yo, I got next, man
Yo, you got the money, man? You ass betting ass, nigga
The shit is right downstairs in the trunk

I'ma get the shit before we go downstairs
Yeah, aight, what's up with that case, man?
Aw, man, it ain't nothing
Ain't nobody snitching or nothing; you know our team is tight
Still sitting on seven digits, unlike you, you broke ass nigga
Fuck outta here, this cat right here
This broke ass, ass betting ass nigga
Betting five thousand ain't got no money
Chili cheese face ass nigga (fuck outta here)
Sandy cake face ass nigga (fuck outta here)
(Laughter)

Ayo, Jay, word up

That comeback shit like they're cooking crack
Shit, I ain't fronting
All I want my pockets green like slum change
You know what I'm saying?
Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, motherfucker, for real
With no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown
Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

Ayo, we patting down pussy from Sugar Hill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling, we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Preemo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few Gs, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even a cappella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

Bring it on if you think you can hang

Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce, heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnxc3xbcgen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness maxc3xb1ana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you're feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, if you think, if you think, if you thinknrnStress
Sunshine, shade, geyeah

I sold it all, from crack to opium
In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsing with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scoping the whole situation, like, Damn!
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hoping my people fleeing
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watching us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchanging dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Praying my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaiting a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(This time, stress, giving this shit up, fuck)

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

As sure as this Earth is turning, souls burning
In search of higher learning
Turning in every direction, seeking direction
My mom's crying, because her insides are dying
Her son trying her patience, keep her heart racing
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it
You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shaking
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him
Trapped, within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressing
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets

You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
(When I was young) you used to hold me
Told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

I found myself reminiscing, remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
I miss him, long as I'm living he's living through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven looking over me, or in hell keeping it cozy
I'm coming, life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend?
Well, me and him feuding, on your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Fronting like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas xe2x80x94 think I'm slipping?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshitting
But my hustle's going too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't trying to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talking to your spirit a little too much

This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set

Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A-Fella y'allnrnYeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo?
Is y'all niggas finished?
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga? Huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, yo, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo

Yo, yo, yo I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out
Scream What's that about?, then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, 'til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns, stack ones yo
Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo
Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas

I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth
But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on their ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
Holler at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
What you want, what you want nigga?

Can I live
To all my niggas that hold coke in their bubble coat
Trying to win with the construction Timbs yo
Can I live
Yo USA, all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams
Two kids, one job, and no man
All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check
Ha ha, all the mamis dame un beso, alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license
I like that shit, I see y'all
All my niggas that say pause after they say some fucked up shit
Hahahahaha, rock on and uh, Jigga shit, Roc-A-Fella forever yo
Uh, Major Coins, yeah, uh-huh
Memph Bleek nigga, uh-huh uhnrnUh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah

You belong to the city (uh-uh-uh, what what)
You belong to the night (uh-uh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night

What the deal, playboy? Just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock, now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit, the Commission remains
Niggas can cross the Ts and, dots the Is
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, wasted
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?

You belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)
You belong to the night (ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uh-uh, pa-pau)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night (the city is mine, that's right)

Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voice box, I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?

You belong to the city (the city is mine)
You belong to the night (yeah, uh, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me)
He's a man of the night (yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)

I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
At the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
On the low though, shh, the city is mine!

You belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine)
You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine)
He's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the night

You belong
You belong
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the nightnrnSomebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
OK, I'm reloaded!

A million

Uh-huh, I did it again niggas
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No

,A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only a single goin' gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doing in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, How bad you wanna know?
Blaow!

A million

Roc-A-Fella y'all, uh, uh
Know my style

Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
Young blood, you better get that, we frying because
Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers yo, they're dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applyin' the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read, He was holdin' no leaks
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out co-ds
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on
Motherfuckers!

Jigga, uh-huh, yeah
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uh
Uh, feel thisnrnRight, right
Yo, peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip
Jumped out like Yo! Who the fuck you with?
Flash the jewels 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural, can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different, let you push the 6 and
Give you a different life and baby if it's right
Jump on it in the morning and ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jewelry when it hits the light
Bitches'll momentarily lose their sight
She said

I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me

You want a cutie with a booty like pow!
Deeper than a mile! Earrings shine like tadow!
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens, get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marble faucets and matching Rolls Royces
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I plays the cut with the Daddy Warbucks
You can call me a slut, who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit, I'm good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a pre-nup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these costs
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

I know what girls like, I'm a fly girl
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me
I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King
The price was like eight digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view, V1 too
Cop you one, cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's park by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
Let 'em make their way through the Benzes and the Rovers
Before they reach the door
Vacate, away a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got to have things locked, champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not ma?

I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what girls like

I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like menrnYeah, I mean like
I gotta be like the pioneer to this shit, you know
I was popping that Cristal
When all y'all niggas thought it was beer and shit, you know
Wearing that platinum shit
When all y'all chicks thought it was silver and shit
(Imaginary playmates)
I got, I got to be the pioneer to this shit, man
Bottom line (Imaginary playmates)
I'ma show you how to do it, check it

Yo, I spit that other shit
That's a nice motherfucker shit
That Fed time follow me around, Deep Cover shit, nigga
You beer money, I'm all year money
I'm Papi, you ain't got to count it, it's all there money
I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money
NARC'd up, marked up, fucked up in the game money
I got bail money, double-XL money
You got flash now, but time will reveal money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
That down-South, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
I got blood money, straight up thug money
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money
You got show dough, little to no dough
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough
I got 900 and 96 plus 4 more dough
You crazy, you fugazi, I'm loco with dough papo

And now you got these young cats acting like they slung caps
All in their dumb raps, talking about how their funds stack
When I see them in the street, I don't see none of that
Damn playboy, where the fuck is the Hummer at?
Where's all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
You're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
Original, Jigga's the future, flow digital
Still busting a gat when shit gets critical
Sit it down, I don't want y'all to get it confused
I rip it down, like I ain't got nothing to lose
(Y'all get it now?)

Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates

Groupies I leave 'em all fucked; niggas, awe-struck
Your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks
Last year, when niggas thought it was all up
But this year I've done it again, Jigga! What the fuck?
Nigga stop whining, Jigga, still shining
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me
I flow like the 5 Series, in various areas
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
You bought a 4.0 you better get your change
Ain't no platinum in those Cartiers, switch your frames
Ain't no manicures on board, then switch your plane

Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates

I mean, like, be truthful, man: how you think you gon' feel, right?
You pull up in your 4.0 with your bitch
I pull up in the 4.6 with my bitch with the seat back
Bumping some other shit, you know, some other shit
You'll probably hop on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch
Ask me some stupid shit like
Yo, yo dog, what's the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6?
Like 30 to 40 grand, cocksucker, beat it! Ha ha
Yo, them shits even got leathers?nrnUh-huh uh huh uh, gee-gee-geyeah
Peeping, watching, streets
You boys are soft like bread
Uh-huh uh huh uh, live from Brooklyn
Uh-huh uh, the streets is watching
Check it, check, uh-huh uh, check

Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous, what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas tryna do
Is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneilly
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching

When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it

Now it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
The streets is watching you when you froze your arms
Niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas wanna steal you
Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya
For the name, niggas don't know the rules
Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool
Force your hand, of course that man's plotting
Smarten up, the streets is watching (it's on)

When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake, can't ignore it

My street mentality: flip bricks forever, know me and money
We like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in 24 hour shifts but, that ain't me now
Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets
See out of space like Mercury, you jerking me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
It said this, 'Let's play fair and we can stay here
I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare'
Ay there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants
The other half in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me
For the first time in my life I was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back?
Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track
But, get my life together like the oils I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop
To set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes
One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just, had to stop
Half of my niggas got time, we done real things
By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured, Shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me
Shit, bitch, who's fucking with that? The streetsnrnUh-huh uh, the saga continues
Motion picture shit

I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in!
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
I swear I saw a light bulb when
He finally realized who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun, lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
But I was like Nah, Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
Peep how my eyes just scour the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a two-hotel town?
Come on now, I peeped your Lexus as you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accent (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking, back up and clap him, one in the abdomen
Do me a favor duke, get two ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable
Friend or foe bitch!nrnHow can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, nah mean?
How can a motherfucker go 'round and hate a nigga
He never even met that, he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef

Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest
You think I'm freaking these chicks, right?
I try not to brush against their chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucker but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me

You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me

I hate all girls with ulterior motives
That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons, no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice, right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact
But ain't no turning back, bring it on
Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me

You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
(Since I was 4 years old
I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)

And niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But Gs is heaven-bound so how I'm gon' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me, my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
Don't plan to leave without a fight, I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife
Next time you're thinking heist better be precise
'Cause I'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I won't see grow
My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo, lucky me

You only know what you see
(I been told, since I was 4 years old
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold
Since I was 4 years old)
You only know what you see
(I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that I've arrived)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see
You don't understand what it takes to be menrnWhat, ssh, y'all, what
Jigga, uh uh uh, uh-huh
Pa-pa, uh, pa-pa, uh
The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all

Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
Cutie, smelling like Miyake, half-Philippine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me, this booty banging
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cause who's getting played is not me
Surely you jest, she said, if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me
I said maturely, You right
But better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ah-ha (say what? Uh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uh, uh, uh)

A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hating 'cause they're less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double-cross you they got to triple-cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) For sure
(She replied, eyes open wide) uh
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life
(Right)

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ah-ha (say what? Uh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (uh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uh, uh, uh)

If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Ugh, uh, for sure)
Catch a case, you catch it with me? (Mm, for sure)
Pawn your jewelry to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uh, now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, 'til the truth prevail? (uh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwing rocks, on the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shall, 'til the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the Heavens, or the Hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my sunshine, uh

Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ah-ha (say what? Uh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uh, uh, uh)
Touch me with, a heart of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, ah-ha
Touch me with, a smile of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshinenrnUh-huh, yeah hah

Never sprung huh?
Yeah, peep the repertoire
Pa-Pause, feel me on this one
Pa-Pause, feel this
Never sprung huh? Know my style

I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches
Gold diggers with your eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, it's a'ight bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum French frames
With the French name in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all
Is like vegetables in my presence, check it
Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard
Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on

More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More Os than you know exist, bitch who you wit

Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em
Chicks dream on him, trick cream on 'em
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em
Sexin' around the way girls down to miras
I'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Pennys
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that
You be the same chick when you leave me
The bankbook and the credit cards
And take everything you came with (it's on)

More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More Os than you know exist, bitch who you wit?

Yeah, here's somethin' niggas gon' find, not at all funny
We takin' all ya bitches, takin' all ya money
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods
If the money was the grass and your ass was a tee
When I hit it with this club love you comin' with me
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall
Kinda tipsy, seein' triple, so I'm fuckin' y'all all
You remind me of this dream I had the night before
I'm kinda hopin' the condom break to have a reason to go raw
I'm playin', hit the showers, hit the money spot
Where all the models play and big money is dropped
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer
I tell you somethin' new, if you don't hop down off that
Butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place
She said, 'I played my cards right and look, I got the ace'
I told her beatboxes, 'slow down baby'
You dealin' with a baller, who, hold ground crazy, it's on

More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More Os than you know exist, bitch who you wit?

This goes out (to my Brooklyn crew)nrnReal niggas do real things
Hanging with the honeys is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things, check

We started out making, small time bacon
Two little niggas baking, talking 'bout whipping cakes
Get clothing and big cheddar, hopin it gets better
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
In front of your building clocking, thought I was making a killing
Right in front of your children, eight-ball in my side pocket
They was corrupt too, disrespecting the fiends I used to
Look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you
In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York
I'm hollering Lifetimes, he hollering Life's Too $hort
Parallel lives and jewels held high
The Range or the rove, get exchanged, for your soul
You know how the game goes, slang to get cheese
And speak in Chinese, everybody gains the same dough
Get your shit scarred fucking with my sick squad
From Marcy, to the Bay y'all, we get large, bitch

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things

So now you own a record label, I got one too
We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew
You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double decker
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats
Dope fiend music, it's drug-related
You can buy it on the corner, get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas
It's just like in the streets mane, how much you get?

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things

That's right, I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes
I started off with nothing ended up with everything
Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane
Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm saying
Always see me at the bank and yes I'm going again
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy
Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy (that's right)

Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get
Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect
$hort Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow
I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know
I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fos
I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go
If you're balling, keep balling, if you jealous, stop
I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac
How real is that?

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Busting my toast off the roof, drinking 90 proof 'til spring
Real niggas do real things, check

Beyotch! $hort Dawg's in the house
Jigga
Much love
$hort Dawg, get your money mane
All the way from the West coast
Uh, how real is thatnrnUh
Uh, yeah
Won't stop niggas
Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game
Jigga! Feel me!
Pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Uh, Roc-A-Fella
Geyeah

We treat this rap shit just like, handling weight
What they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
Ain't trying to, kill 'em at first just, building clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, for sure

Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke

Ge-ge-geyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
Got your whole block now, pumping my work
My CDs is like keys for you Willie's who
Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-twos
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
'Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit
Never pitching for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fish-scale, y'all niggas is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Dakota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa

Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like selling smokenrnUh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn, so where you from?)

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they're atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
Damn, I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politic they selves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn, so where you from?)

Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought their deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn,)nrnThroughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done (right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (yeah)
For that I am eternally grateful

Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games, stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me, Don't let 'em hold you back
What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame
You was newly separated trying to escape ya world
And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody that created crack
Had me thinking the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized, so please play this back
While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act
You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about how the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
That's a savage, you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

You must love me
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Oh yeah

We used to fight every night but I never would suffer
Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense, real intense as we got older
Never believed it would lead to be popping one in your shoulder
Where my rings? Knew you had it 'cause you took too long
As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffing and puffing gun in my hand told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was begging for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined
Drove me berserk, saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed 
What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn, what the fuck I done now?
Running around in a circle thinking I'm assed-out
Hot gun burning my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene, how could I go out that way?
Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
You must love me

What after all the wrong I've done
You must love me
I know you must
You must love me

Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people that I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us
You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no
But it was one of those days when nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip out of town
Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face asking me could you go
I agreed said send her everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain the strange feeling that I caught in the vein
I'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right
I'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life
You must've love me

After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yea yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love menrnSorry boys
But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last
Bleek's gonna be a good rapper
New, improved Jay-Z I quit
I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around
Sorry Big, I tried, honest
Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots
The bar's closing, where we going to for breakfast?
Roc-A-Fella y'all OK, I'm reloaded!

Bringing the drama
Trying to come up in the game Marcy
Add a couple of dollar signs to my name Roc-A-Fella y'all
One of the best!
Waiting for my day to come
Just give me the word

Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your little nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hood rat and creep to Mickey D's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJs
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all
That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Flashy, fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like Why little nigga?
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
And I'm serious

Waiting for my day to come
Just give me the wordnrnTake the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standing on the corners, bopping
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleeing the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controlling the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishing, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the long shots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleeping on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5s
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, Still, y'all don't know me.
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improving
I'm tryna murder everything moving, feel me?

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!nrnCome on, life, death
Here, gone, yo

If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die

Don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
In the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm getting my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sitting in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's OK
But life's short, don't miss a day, uh

If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die

, don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep getting it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas

I got a lot to look back on, in '88 got my crack on
Ten years later getting my rap on
Getting shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians, got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts, fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got demands to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed?
I ain't mad, I must've smoked a ton of reefer
Sipped Coronas with Latifah, broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again, if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family, reincarnated I'll shorten the time
That I waited to get paid, tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool-Aid and your blood run thicker
Never shed tears, cry liquor, my nigga

If I die don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep banging these songs, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die

, don't cry my niggas
Just stay getting high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga

I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
Born to live forever through life's struggles
I cut corners and took drastic measures
Seen niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me, too often, I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feeling haunted
Ready to leave this world that I'm lost in
My only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn, keep flossing
As long as my name lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorching preparing for life
Afterlife still torching and blazing these mics
It'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights
And I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
(Without my physical portion)
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the Heights tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door
What you thought, huh?
What you thought, nigga?

If I should die don't cry, my niggas
Just stay getting high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga
When I die

, don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep getting it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die

, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die

I'd tell Big they're still hearing his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealing in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives, answer their whats and whys
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die, don't cry, my niggasnrnI'm rolling with Roc-A-Fella, man
'Cause they got money, man, ha ha

Uh-huh, uh-huh uh UH, uh-huh, Hova

Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga laying shocked when the fool hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly

Imagine how I stroke, see how I was flowing on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hating and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're acting raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimpxe2x80x94what a tragedy!

Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack
Niggas threw two at me, I threw four back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Biggs had the gold Ac', Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest
When I come through with the Glock jet black
You niggas step back
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater, Jaz-O finish this shit!

Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurting me

Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since, life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life's within us
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us
Fuck it!
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem players wall my picture
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: money, cash, hoes, how real was that nigga? What!

Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes (uh!)

Roc-A-Fella forever, CEO, what! (what?)
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings
While y'all player hate we in the upper millions
What's the dealings (huh)? It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they're gon' criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck. I'm just a crook on this song
Bed-Stuy Brook-Nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what!

D-M-X and my dogs bite
Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night
Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit
Let 'em go and I bet they know what'll happen
When we clap shit
Acting like we owe 'em something
Then we show 'em something
Talking greasy, I think they found 'em down the road or something (Wooh)
Fucking with a mad man in a bad mood
Is like fucking with a mad dog that wasn't fed food
And the only thing that's stopping him is you (what!)
So the only thing that he'll be dropping is you (what!)
Chopping in two (come on!)
Then he drop it to Clue, and the response from the street:
This is one dog that loves raw meat (woo!)
But getting back to, just 'cause I, love my niggas

Let a nigga holler Where my niggas?

Pa-pause
My nigga Swizz
Uh huh, uh huh
Don't stop, bitch
Uh, uh huh, yeah
Respect the game yo

OK OK OK, so now the guy's working for Jay-Z
Making hot songs
But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z
Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what
Not selling any records, fuck you pay me
Oh you want me in your video, fuck you pay me
No one's coming to your shows huh, fuck you pay me
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?
You can't sell any singles in the stores?
You light a match you blow the jointnrnUh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Bitch!

Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?
He said, Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said, The world don't stop, I got to keep keep on.
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, 'cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said, I'm never going back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, This is my dad?
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitching
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And recycling it through the ghettos
And building back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitching on each other
I got partners doing 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doing shit
If you didn't snitch, bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it going on
We got the money
Ain't got nothing to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizing

You rat bastard!nrnUh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek

It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff.
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, Jigga, what up?

I done came up (uh), put my life on the line (uh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he must've picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I would've been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It would've seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (What up Bleek?) and I paused

I done came up (uh), put my life on the line (uh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up (uh), put your life on the line (uh)
Soaked the game up (uh), now it's your time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, And what?
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah

I done came up (uh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's your time to shine
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's your time to shine
Time to change up, no more second in line
Yeah, yeah

Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or

And I'm thinking, I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch
I'm trying to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six
Roll the windows down and, wave round this bitch
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch
Gotta talk to the natives, let 'em know I'm here
For all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters

And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they're outside

And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his bean
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it, like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm looking for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight 'til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I don't fucking care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiing, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, flooding your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall
Taking shots of Louie 'til I fall
Nutting to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, 'til I swear Big moved
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's costing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mack, I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggas nuts, like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walking
Heat from the Larkin, keep on sparking
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparkling
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawking
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not trying to meet the Sergeant, at the precinct
Eating cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killing your pops
You feeling The LOX, nigga, why you grilling The LOX?
If this rap shit don't work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangsters don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggas can't deny it
Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm opening up, or headline
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic
Any nigga ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L-O-X
Ruff Ryder you heard? We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was coming
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me falling off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm sonning your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggas coming to lose
Something to prove? Spit it, we can have a spray off
I lay off wack niggas and kill 'em on my day off
Ain't nutting for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave, bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a mil stacking nigga who pull quick, still packing
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas
Shooting backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for Roc-A-Fella
Screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna
Whoa watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thing, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six Range
Shit mayne, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
Muh'fuckers is nodding and throwing up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak, man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-Classes
Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, bitch! What the fuck, ya heard me? Hahahaha
Put some more beat on that jointnrnYeah, uh-huh, watch this y'all
Uh, watch this y'all
C'mon, Jigga, watch this y'all
C'mon, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Huh! Watch this y'all
It's Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!
It's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!
'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah
I'm really like that

As a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed something to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leaving nothing to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas running in place
Getting nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winning, 'til the earth stop spinning
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering
My motto is, simply I will not lose!
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm coming with the razors
Still flashing ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return

Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up

Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hating, 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fucking with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fucking with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothing for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (ha ha)
Rappers y'all, running around like I won't gun ya down

So when you like you find MC's so impolite

Everything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart

Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me
We extort 'em as soon as they record 'em, Bleek

You jel like Flubber
I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set
Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate
Mr. I don't cop nothing less than eight
And anything involved with my name, regardless of the fame
It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya
I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths

If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go

Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's Seven Degrees of Separation and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God

Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man.
He'd say, Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are.
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So, five ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five ten years from now
They're gonna miss Jay-Z

When we just cop them things homie, the chromey wheels
Both arms are chunky, the sleeves on chill
Any given times a hundred Gs in your grill
Don't talk to me 'bout MCs got skills
He's alright, but he's not real
Jay-Z's that deal, with Sigs in the field
Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel
Fuck, you got a flow, that's cool with me
You got a little dough, that's cool with me
You got a little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew to three
Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rapping the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jacking our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows trying to wild out
The game is ours, we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw yo' hands up, niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! (Throw the hands up), c'mon

Let's gonrn(Millennium flow)
Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
(This is bullshit y'all)
In New York City for the first day in the trial of
(I'm gone)
The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
(Uh, uh-huh-uh, uh, uh-huh-uh, uh)
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

Ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killing the track
Testify 'til me spilling the smack
Now they got me for trafficking, racketeering, audio crack
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokesman
A broke man, approaching the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemming from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was using cut, I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowadays, the jury got their brow raised
Listening to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out

You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the trial of the century

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokesman

How come, you label your brand of dope
Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called Vol. 2
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link

The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokesman

Despite the grim outlook at this point the rapper has been known to emerge triumphant in the face of adversity

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokesman

Jay-Z is taking the stand

Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
Ahem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiraling, going backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time

While the jury is inside deliberating outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokesman

Well the verdict has just been announced: Not guilty!
It is complete pandemonium out here!
People are cheering and hugging, there he is
Jay-Z is exiting the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him
And people are just rushing up to him
Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!nrnUh-huh, uh
Jigga Man, uh-huh MC
That's right
Swizz Beatz
Uh, uh, come on

It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)

You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)

I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

You know the flow sicker, know Jigga, mo' sicker now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh, without blazing chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfucking stoop raised me
Ringing in the hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you, baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggas was blazing
Twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow, baby

It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)

You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggas
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, guess it was all for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit, I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writing raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

It's the things that you do
That make me feel so

And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

You know I've traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jaz's back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
Yeah I'm here to show and prove
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowing on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do, it's alright with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'ma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do

It's the things that you do that make me feel so

And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain

It's the things that you do that make me feel so

Save for what? Ball 'til your days is up
This place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such
How they make it where you afraid to fuck
They gave us drugs then turned around and investigated us
Life is short, then you on life support
So in between it all, I'ma say I seen it all, watch me

Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (uh, watch me)
At any, chance you hit (that's right), we live for the moment
(Yo watch, watch) Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
(Watch me!) You see me around some cheese
(Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them Gs
(Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed
(Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me
(Watch me!)

Watch me turn something out of nothing, turn Platinum from Gold
Watch me light the Cohiba off the Viking stove
I take an empty bank account, fill it with Os
I take an empty building then I fill it with hoes
Watch me, cop that Coupe, shine for the ladies
Have 'em saying, Damn I never seen a watch that blue.
And while they're still mesmerized I pop that cooch
Shit, law enforcement couldn't stop that dude
Guess who? Fresh off of Vol. 2
Back at you, peep the numbers my album do
They call me Champagne Hova, wake up with a hangover
When y'all think the game's over, do the same thing over
Still with the same soldiers
Still getting brain and it's plain ain't a thing gon' change Hova
Hop out the truck, hand on my cock and nuts
Who got the bank? I'm stocking it up (watch me)

Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get (watch me)
At any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars
(Watch me!) You see me around some cheese
(Watch me!) See me with hustlers around them Gs
(Watch me!) Blowing 'dro running through pounds of weed
(Watch me!) At the bar baby, round's on me
(Watch me!)

Yo, the watch too rocky, need shades
Continental sitting on blades, spinning like waves
Gun too Brock-y, behave
Big shot, plus I'm feeling like Rocky these days
Ice don't melt, I could ski through a heatwave
Nights won't help you see Jay, it'll be day
My shit too bright, I rip through mics
Plus I push more powder than Crystal Light
Chick mad, said I hold my pistol too tight
Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life
I buy out the bar, spit Cris' through the mic
See Jigga in the 6 and all the shit you like
See Jigga giving dick to every bitch you like
I told her, It's Jay-Day and Hit-You-Night.
You wanna, see me again you gotta get two dykes
I got rules I can't hit you twice, you heard me?
Watch me!

Place yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)

'Cause I don't fucking need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em looking good
But I don't fucking feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezing
Talking about, What's the reasons?
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's beep beep and I'm picking them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be living it up?
Shit, I part with nothing, y'all be fronting
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothing, never happen; I'll be forever macking
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waiting
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!

Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Coming straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my scenario
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointing, they say: There he go!
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us coming down on your SLAB
Living ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hating I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I'm flying to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breaking these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start popping like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, getting throwed on the flip
Getting blowed with the motherfucking Jigga Man, fool!

Keeping lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball
Holler at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rapping, baby
I would still be riding Mercedes
Coming down and sipping daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Coming down in candied toys
Smoking weed and talking noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sitting on blades, sipping that Ray
Standing on the corner of my block, hustling
Still getting that 'caine
Half what I paid slipping right through customs
It'll sell by night, it's egg-shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimping, spending cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughing it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

Think there's been a murderer
I ah, think there's been a
I I think there's been a
Think there's been a murderer
I ah, think there's been a
I I think there's been a

I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk
Kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) You going with us
I held round-table meetings so we could go on and discuss
Not only money but all the emotions going through us
Why we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him
Look in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary), hoping God forgave him
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous, often finding ourself in the eyes of strangers
(Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
Back to live action, I'm packing, I'm still in the mix
Like new hits, I think I'm going over your head a little bit
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now
Jay-motherfucking-Z; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and I ah

Think there's been a murderer
I ah, think there's been a
I I think there's been a
Think there's been a murderer
I ah, think there's been a
I I think there's been a

My infatuation with autos led to autos getting sprayed
Houses getting broken in, quarters getting trayed
Bricks getting chopped, mom's pots getting used
One thrown in that water, try the soda if there's two (bring it back)
Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seats, roof gone
Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon
I gotta do Shawn, 'cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm
I was getting my loot on, nigga I'm too strong
Eat 'til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth
The twin brother of Rich Porter, separated at birth
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto
See the place that corrupted us
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit
Plus ain't nobody loving us; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and I ah

Think there's been a murderer
I ah, think there's been a
I I think there's been a
Think there's been a murderer

See my life is like a see-saw
And until I move this weight it's gon' keep me to the floor
Travel with me through my deep thoughts
Y'all can't learn Jigga by the shit y'all be reading in The Source
It's deeper of course
Follow the life of this reckless minor
At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver
Playing, cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us
Flipping a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers!)
Buck-thirty on the turns
Reckless abandon, when I'm standing on this pedal
Hand on my metal, mind is on this time they're trying to give me
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or
Somebody to tell me that they felt me
I tried to play the hand you dealt me
But you gave me five funnies an' shit
I was hungry I needed menage money
Nothing less than a 520; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is

Think there's been a murderernrnI remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin
But when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck
Ignorant bastard, I'm taking it back to day one
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun
For niggas that think I spend my days in the sun
Well here's the shock of your life, the Glock not the mic
Homie I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street
You still fucking up then trust me I still creep
Yeah I know the platinum chain be looking real sweet
But reach and I bury niggas sixty feet deep
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs
Separate fathers from their daughters, why bother
I'm a crook like you, I took like you
I disobeyed the law, threw out the book like you
How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like who
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me

Come and get me!
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-come
Come and get me! Co-co-co-come and get me!

Uh, straight gangster nigga
Roc

Yo, the summer's 'bout to get hot
Niggas home from jail and they're plotting
Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top
The Continental T, got 'em resenting me
God I work hard, please don't envy me
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job
All y'all remember is the part about me parking the hard
What about all them days I was walking my dogs
Barking at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, Where them dollars at?
Imagine, being skinny growing up around brolic cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start popping back
Round the way, niggas called me Bobby Boucher
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away
Pull out your gat, car jack me, take my cruise away
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey

I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, come and get me
Come and get me

I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood
Made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle
Went on MTV with durags, I made them love you
You know normally them people wouldn't be fucking with you
'Til I made 'em understand why you do what you do
I expected to hear, Jay, if it wasn't for you,
But instead, all I hear is buzzing in your crew
How y'all scheming, trying to get accustomed to my moves
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
But I got pride I'm a nigga first
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
That's how Jigga work
The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here
So when y'all feel that the time is right

I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, come and get me
Come and get me

Ayo yo, ayo yo
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle
I'm treating it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna
My game change but my mind frame remains the same
I gotta protect what's mine
Shit I started from nothing; zero, zip
I made my way hustling, I don't owe niggas shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
Ask Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib
He'd find another gun that I hid
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is
Everyday like a hundred-and-six, shit

I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga

Motherfuckers!nrnGeyeah, NYMP the realest, uh
This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggas

Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive
Blocks'll have you, trying to maintain your course
Through the potholes and gravel
Hot holes and what-have-you, trying to clock dough
Foes trying to pop shots through you by code
Pigs trying to grab you and lock up your soul
Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle
(Bucka bucka bucka) fiends trying to gaffle you
Not only coke heads but the Feds in the Mercury Topaz
After you, up the avenue
Trying to give you big numbers, you got math to do
Trying to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool
I caught smaller cases trying to get capital
Up against the wall, trying to pass through
Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls
Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like

Uh, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas
N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas
Uh, uh-huh-uh-UH, N.Y.M.P. the realest
Marcy Brooklyn

Yo, I come through, getting money, sitting on twenties
Niggas throwing me shade, but ain't shit sunny
Hot shells only thing niggas could get from me
Cocktails thrown in your living room, ka-boom!
I'm so confrontational
They shoulda never let me go on probation yo
I'm a hustler, except that
No correctional facilities can correct that
I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at
It's where that dough is homie, gotta get that
Gotta get away, some try but head back
Uh, street smart niggas got left back
Some died, they left stacks
Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice
Jigga been cold as fuck before ice
Not before Christ, but a long fucking time
Get your mind right niggas

Uh uh-huh, uh-UH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggas
Marcy feel me

I looked death in the face years back
I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back
I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live
You gotta bounce back homie, the streets don't give
I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?
Not Rudy Giuliani, not Hillary Rodham
Still I still pop him
Shit, I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now
I think big when I spit at you now
Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get you
Between life and death, they killed my spirit
So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball
I empowered myself, teacher said I was a lost cause
'Cause I used to roam them halls
Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college
Who woulda thought I'd make it Big like Ms. Wallace?

Uh, yeah, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggas

Fuck with menrnWho ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Ducking the plain cops, pushing endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubbling raw
Skully tilted, pants sagging, damn near touching the floor
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&amp;R's had me feeling like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt

I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took short sleeves and lounging to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do the crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me

I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
From the nada to the Prada
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dollar, you became my habit
Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like dxc3xa9jxc3xa0 vu

Sometimes you given just because
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations

In the hands of gold diggers you never enough
Rings, things, just never enough
But me and you together gon' shine to the end
I mean the thugs love ya, but ya girl's best friend

I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
'Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
All black in the club, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
'Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm their ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn they're glad
Let me sit up in the whip 'til I launch it back
Snap their neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And everybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon
Uh-huh uh uh

I'm cancer to the Hamptons
20 million a wop, ransacking mansions
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, shots gon' stand you up
Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understanding much
I hustle for the duckets
Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
I just love it
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love y'all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and that's right we coming for the title
Do you believe? It's Hova the GodnrnUh, yo don't get mad at me
I don't love 'em, I fuck 'em
I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
I replace 'em with another one
You had to see she keep calling me B.I.G
And my name is Jay-Z
She be all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofa, man
I eat a hostess from her open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'ma pimp her, it's over man
(It's over man, it's over man)

Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!

Yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You better check her dawg
She keep begging me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

Cool out homie
You better keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From cats who order Cris' play the floor with the Knicks
It can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga Man scorch your bitch
Play the four dot, Jigga Man go first
Then we all rock 'til we all hot
You know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got the bitches in the smash
Make them drawers drop fast
'Cause we get more cash than the average nigga?
All them hoes like Damn, I gotta have this nigga
'Cause I'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that?
You would fuck mine
How the hell can you knock that?
I'm just playing the cards choosenly
Jigga Man, who you supposed to be?

The Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming
Like a demon fiending for the semen
Chrome gleaming like the dome on Keenan
Gone while I'm leaning smoking
I'm whip it in the stomach
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Popping that pussy
Sweating 'til no fluid is left
When I come in the party with Jay we gon' do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Tripping while we pimping these hefers
Player lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us 'cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put the dick up inside her
Can't help it if she's in love with a rider

Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezing
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holding down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn't the life meant for you
You're a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that's mine

You give a nigga a foot, he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm
You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qur'an
Or Old Testament, don't test him then

Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know, geah geah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah

You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watching
And I only use his waist to keep my Glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doing the popping
And if you don't know, guess who's doing the dropping
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move; that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do
Shit, I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say Jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that? When I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone
From what the block has spoken, my God
Everybody stressing, who's his baby's moms?
Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ah

I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know
I lost my Pops when I was eleven, mm, twelve years old
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is taking its toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holler at your lad!
I grew up pushing snowflake to niggas that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggas before me, with a chance to write their own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory
Before reaching puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, sniff
Smell me, nigga? The real me, nigga, minus the rumors
Holler if you feel me, nigga

The streets is not only watching but they're talking now?
Shit, they got me circling the block before I'm parking now
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitching, I'm just cautious now
Sub, under the parka, extra cartridge now
Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic and Sprint
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in Jumu'ah I know 'stafallah
Niggas wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me's to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you, I got guns like Neo in Matrix
Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like Karo
Or soft like Play-Doh, get knocked off like Fredo Corleone
They find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggas that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reaching
Clip you then I cross you then I'm leaving
Apply full court pressure
Like .44 Taurus get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt, lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans
Niggas wanna despise the team; 'til I play head coach
And straight up, divide their team
Trade their man for some pies and a couple of things
'Til the bullet ah, motherfuckers! YeahnrnGeah wass up?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs, arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it, mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming Don't do it!
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like Damn, I'ma be a failure
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby mamma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister going make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Quran
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

Life yeah uh
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be lifenrnSup ma? You want to roll with us, you know what I'm saying?
It's good, it's love, it's all love
We got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare
We gon' really get to know one another
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
nah mean? I'm here for you, yo

Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rolling with them thugs from the R-O-C
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hood rat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rolling with the R-O-C
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me

Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice

How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow
I could teach you how to roll, teach you 'bout fly kicks
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach
Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek
Get your mind right baby, going through mine crazy

For fucking with me, that ain't all you can be
Just put your mind to it you can go real far

They say, pimping is dead (What?), man, pimping ain't dead
These hoes just scared and they're blind trying and dying to be led (Mm)
But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
Get their mind right and feed 'em
Now I don't need 'em (Uh-uh), but I can do that there
Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley-Temple my hair
So I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place (Place)
Got yo' bitch all on my line, and now she up in my face
Is this yo' bitch? Is that yo' bitch? 'Cause if she's not, she mine
She falling for a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line

But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch
You heard the rhetoric: Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothing gon' change
For nothing else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls

Shit mane, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine

I giving 'em whiplash when I'm whipping the whip fast
Which one? Pick one nigga, I got a sick stash
Continental Ts, no tints like I got a thick stack
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6s
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
I got money for a room, it's just the fact that I'm trill
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
Spin away, spend a day trying to pull menage
Just macking this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers
'Specially when you're sitting on 20's they get nauseous
Standing in the Azure with white Air Forces

You can catch me in the parking lot
Hollering at bitches, parking lot pimping
Everyday we be off the chains
Working with grain, sitting on them things
Trying to find out where them dollars at (dollars at)
So when I holler at you, holler back (holler back)
Everyday we be off the chains
Ain't nothing different, parking lot pimping

Holler at me mami! Sigel
You can catch Mack in the parking lot, pimping crazy

That's four dubs, not S-4 dub
Stash box, push Hot Wheel like Matchbox
Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box
160, push my wheel, mash cops
Cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop
Run 60, you Big Will, match cop
Looking through the rear view and Mack was wyling
New driver, screwdriver, the cracked steering column
Pushing something stolen, blasting, picture me rolling
Back then couldn't picture me ruling
Now the truth different, Mack come through Coupe roof missing
I'm the truth 'til my fucking roof missing
Mac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons
Feathers getting plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen

You can catch me in the parking lot
Hollering at bitches, parking lot pimping
Everyday we be off the chains
Working with grain, sitting on them things
Trying to find out where them dollars at (dollars at)

Everyday we be off the chains
Ain't nothing different, parking lot pimping

Yo, ayo I dip dip dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade
So I called up, murder to further my parking lot pimping
Told 'em get the Impala so I can start dipping
Lay back, seat recline, they notice the hand
Car moving slow, driven by the invisible man
Everything on the dash, digital and
I got a fast stash box don't make me spit at you man
In the parking lot, where I spark a lot
I come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks
Bleek, turn up the beats
Turn up the heat then we burn up the streets, bitch!

You can catch me in the parking lot
Hollering at bitches, parking lot pimping

Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style
But dog, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile
I still got the crack heads I.D
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth
I still take cabs to that capsule spot
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops
And the game ain't change, niggas is taught different
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slipping
That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat
Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat
And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana
You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Time Warner
Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit
They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get
And you snitch-ass niggas wanna peep my shit
But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get

See what this game made, and of age I came
And you up-and-coming rappers know you're young to this game
I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again
I don't need no applaud to clap again
Let alone, no award from rap to win
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine llama
Cut your hand off if you're fucking with my product
That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift
We all know fucked-up money don't pay rent
You're short with my ones, you're short one thumb
You can't come up short where the fuck I'm from
We got dues to pay, new tools to spray
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today
You know the Uz'll spray if you refuse to pay
And I move the yay nigga day by day

Holler! Holler!nrn1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holler at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

Yeah what up man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm trying to lock the spot down, holler at me

Alright; hold on, Hova, line one

Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you're free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life.
Or you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then before they look up you're selling the town cook-up
Or gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangster, I think I'mma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holler

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holler at your boy
Whas up Sig? This Chris out the Young Guns dog
What up?
I'm ready to smash these niggas in the rap game
The niggas taking too long with that advance money and shit
Yeah
Talking 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
Yeah I feel that
I know you're well connected dog
Let me holler at somebody real
Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You're new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you're small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties 'til they're tired
With no credit, you know you're sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who getting it, dead it
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, 'til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it

You'll understand soon enough

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all
Plus your mom call me son around you since I was small
Shit, I watched you mature, nah, this ain't right
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
Over my right shoulder, I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you're liking a guy
'Cause if he sense that your feeling's too intense, his pimp'll die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day
It must be sad, though it hurts to say
We could never be a item, don't even like him
You deserve better, this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me
There's better guys out there other than me
(You need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that you know?)
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a PhD
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be
If they found that you was hugging me
My conscience is fucking with me

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

Man, I look in the eyes of our
This our kid this whole life we made together
We're trying, really trying to make it work
I'm young, and I ain't ready, and I told you

It ain't like, I ain't tell you from day one, I ain't shit
When it comes to relationships, I don't have the patience
Now it's too late, we got a little life together
And in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever
But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever
A different girl every night forever; told you to leave
But you're stubborn and you love him and
No matter what, despite all the fucking and the cheating
You still won't leave him, now you're grieving
And I feel bad, believe me
But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy
Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate
You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna fuss
You're the mother of my baby
I don't want you to hate me, this is about us
Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be
And 'cause I love you, I want you to leave, please

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand

Mm listen ma
I mean, I seen you're working two or three jobs
Daddy left; I, I thought I was making things better
I made it worse

Dear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell
Writing this scribe, thinking 'bout how you must feel inside
You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow
Goddamn, I ain't the young man that you used to know
You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like
Bling-bling ice; I was wrong in hindsight
Shit, we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out
But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules
I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews
And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs?
Co-workers saw me on the corner slinging Larry Love
Meanwhile, you're working hard, like 2 or 3 jobs
Trying to feed me and my siblings, making an honest living
Who am I kidding? I call myself easing the load
I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary
Try to understand, please

Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you
Soon you'll understand
Let him hold you, let him touch you

'Cause when I pull, I always pop, that's why I'm living today

Yo, when I meet ya, I heat ya down
When I greet ya, meet ya with pound
Not the handshake, but the kind that make ya demand a wake
The kind that put land over your face
I pop ya, let doctor stitch ya
I-N-F-R-A, will not miss ya
I move light, like my shoes too tight
Leave niggas confused from the day to the night
At night, see the light, when the pistol's sparking
Daytime it gets dark when that pistol barking
I keep cash 'case cops arrest me
'Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
You shall repent 'fore you spend a red cent
If not you, somebody of close descent
Thou shalt not fuck with raw me, or he
Face a thousand deaths from Mr. Shawn Corey
Carter, rap harder like I'm part of a cult
Like Cuban cigar maker 'cept I'm hard to smoke

See when I'm low on digits, I push blow in a blizzard
I'm a player for real, I post and pivot
Coke distribute, be where the ghosts visit
Where the demons live, shit, my scene is vivid
Squeamish kids, y'all get the fuck outta this verse
It's about to get so obscene in a minute
I seen and live it, I did some things I admit it
Wasn't proud of it, but I was a child, fuck it
Kept a pow tucked in a brown belt
Couldn't sit down, big gun kept sticking my pelvis
Shit, it was either that or be living with Elvis
Niggas is jealous, hell is hot, you heard X
Wanted to tell God that I don't deserve this
Was afraid that he'd tell me I deserve less
My life was nervous, you haven't heard stress
'Til you heard the cries of my mama, me giving her drama
Told her I ain't promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day
And before she could say Jay
I was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality
Men gotta do men things for men salary
Bad Boy, not Puff or Mike Lowery
Damn B.I.G. woulda been proud of me

Ah shit man
Young Hova, ya heard?
Who could fuck with him?
Uh, uh, geahnrnDamn, how I'ma say this shit?
Ay, ay, Dad
Yeah, it's your boy
You don't remember me?
I wanna talk to you, scrap

I remember being kicked out the house 'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crookxe2x80x94just like you
Even niggas in the hood was shook or they just liked you
'Cause all they said was, Little Whitey, look, I'm just like you
But dawg, I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all, we never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dawg, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fixed a flat, none of that sorts of shit
Nigga you was an abusive pops, fuck
You left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach News to box, gotta teach News to block
And that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach News the block
It's about time we have a father to son (Nigga sit down)
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughtersxe2x80x94nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick, pussy, you could, ooh
How you gon' leave these memories in the back of my mind?
I can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine
You turned me out, the reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hitting shots
Reason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court
Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught
Look at your hands, manxe2x80x94damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, no replies (Nothing!)
No digits, numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest nights
Nigga, some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (Shit embarrassing)
Damn, we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant
We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps
And to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop, shit

Daddy, where have you been?
And when you come home, you got us here all alone
Mommy, where daddy went?
You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him
Mommy, what happened then?
Who was you cheating on him? Why he's always beating on you?
Daddy, where have you been?
Nigga, you gon' hear me out

I wanted to walk just like you (Remember?)
Wanted to talk just like you (Word?)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like you (And I'd get happy)
Wanted to drink Miller nips and smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm going to court just like you
I would say, My daddy loves me and he'll never go away
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan?
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income, always late with the rent
You said you was coming through, I would stay in the hallway
Always playing the bench (Waiting) and that day came and went
Fuck you very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me, I will never hurt again
Would never ask mommy, Why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor? Why is life so ugly?
Mommy, why is your eyes puffy?
Please don't cry, everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world, we don't need him, right? (Right!)
Mommy driving 6's now (Yeah) I got riches now (Yeah)
I bought a nice home for both of my sisters now

Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born hustlers, I was birthing 'em

For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky

Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist

H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!

I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me

That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!

Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back selling their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get your damn hands up!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me

Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
God damn, she's fine, but she parties all the time!

She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile-High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model

With a throwback jersey and a fitted
Might blow a bag of Hershey in the sidd-ix
Or might take sips of army with a chidd-ick, I'm so sick with it
Lamping in the Hamptons
The weekends man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playing guts on the cruise, Hermxc3xa8s boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies help me say it now

She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-two's on the 6 before
I am, killing 'em out there, they're needing first aid
'Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So, sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie B pants
Waist is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city, doing a buck-sixty

(Roc-A-Fella y'all!)nrnTurn my music high, high, high, higher
You don't know what you're doing doing doing
Sure I do

I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'll follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hopping out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clapping them flamers before I became famous
For playing me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

I am Hov
You don't know what you're doing doing doing
Sure I do

I tell you the difference between me and them
They're trying to get their ones, I'm trying to get them Ms
One million, two million, three million, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now looking at the forty million boy
I'm raping Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man

R-O-C
You don't know what you're doing doing doing
That's where you're wrong

I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grinding G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewinding me back
Could make 40 off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothing
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them, hah
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now looking at one smart black boy
Mama ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker

I will not lose
You don't know what you're doing doing doing
Put something on it

I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a well
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay

Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live. Notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick

And my record's moving out the store?
Young fucks spitting at me, young rappers getting at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you getting money like athletes
Youngins ice-grilling me. Oh, you not feeling me?
Fine, it cost you nothing, pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for fronting
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs

Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll mxc3xa9nage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waiting in the wing, but I'm doing my thing
Where's the love?

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

And then the Fugees gonna break up
Now everyday I wake up, somebody got something to say
What's all the fucking fussing for?
Because I'm grubbing more and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like round ball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill sound boys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit
And I did handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing running is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

Fuck; then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talking to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies. Why you all aggie?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?

I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere locking a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry

Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, saying, Let me see that clip!
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see. That's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up their buddies, now they're saying they love me
Used to tell their friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you

I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes

Yeah, I've seen 'em coming down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

Come on now
All I need in this world of sin

I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (woo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!)
But no ad-libbing, nigga, stick to the script
Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you
And they're coming to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckers will sue
In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucker to do
When I'm surrounded by squeal muh'fuckers like you?
But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew
R to the O to the C coming true

All I need

And I'll be on my way

Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all)
Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)
The whole Roc is jumping, we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwing up on them self like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you want it?)
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along with your little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, looking at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We've got no respect, no law or governing
Why you fucking with him?
Matter fact, why you fucking with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby

All I need
Rocawear (check)
Nike Airs (check)
Mean bucket (uh huh)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
(All I need)nrn[Jay-Z:]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No, he's not around. Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through itxe2x80x94not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Eminem:]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!xe2x80x94That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just axe2x80x94

[Eminem (Jay-Z):]
xe2x80x94renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
('Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

[Jay-Z:]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Eminem:]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a muh'fuckin'xe2x80x94

Feel me now, listen

Momma loved me; Pop left me
Mickey fed me; Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga, no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Momma raised me; Pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him; I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears; Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly. Shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy; I could do no wrong
Years going past fastxe2x80x94let's move along
Kitchen table: that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out; Dame believed
Primo laced me; Ski did, too
Reasonable Doubt: classic, shoulda went triple
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Grandma dressed me; plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on Ls, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggasxe2x80x94V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a niggaxe2x80x94what's up, Hoff'?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in; clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephewxe2x80x94time to slow it down
October 21st: Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then, a baby girl
Momma loved me; Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay
Loves you to death; won't let no trouble come your way
Oh can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November; how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too. It's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely
'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm black and living a movie,
Not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming: you're one-hit away
Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My momma loves menrnSo I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise

Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla!

I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me Hova
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right?

One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two

One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(And) four, breathe easy
One, two, three, four, breathe easy

Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers

One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three

Ain't they know it, when it comes to love
I don't lie (we don't lie, man)
And the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (I may never say never)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from (too many ladies, ha)

I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

Woo! Who you loving, who you wanna be hugging? Heh
Who you with, who you wanna be fucking?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm moving through her student body union
And she, call me Professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school

I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

Huh, who you loving, who you wanna be fucking?
Who said what? Why you tripping, girl? Why is you fussing?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging round with part time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries in ten places at once (Woo!)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
And some day, I slow down, but for now, I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business

I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I get off tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

I'm looking for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louie, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

I'm trying girls out
Just trying girls out
Put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I get off tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper
'Cause I would love to date ya
Holler at ya when I come off tour

I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie
And the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my no can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from
I'm trying girls out (Waiting patiently)
Just trying girls out (Until I find the one for me)nrnYeah, yeah, it's here niggas! (woo-wee!)

We got this locked for two reasons: we from the hood
Plus we promised both our mommas that we would

We copped and we crash it
Then we cop again 'cause we are classic
Let me speak for ya R, we Scarface re-enacted
The Godfather trilogy re-casted
But it's real like we grieving for Aaliyah with the masses
But I hope my boy Dash get to see her when he passes
I feel her soul when the leaf passes
When the wind blows, it's almost like I see her in the Hamptons
Even more reason to be up in them mansions
Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya
Big too, 'til they put me in the grave
I'ma floss 'til they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade
'Til Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day

Tied her hands up, this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked

Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear-view mirror
Oh, her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Louboutin's with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)

I storm in, she storm out
It's like The War of the Roses going on in my house
It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just suffering from love deprivation
So I gotta give her thug reparations
Put it in the life until love leg is shaking
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughing and we back friends

You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug
You know the words girl let's make up
So much love to be made
Instead of screaming, Who's to blame?
Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so

Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
'Cause I had the crisp tee on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezing icicles
On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, You never spend time with me, what's up with that?
Translated it means (hit it harder from the back)
Yeah, she hid my car keys
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

Why don't you just spend the night

Put our problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight

Sex so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pulling her close, she's pulling away
I'm trying to kiss her mouth but she keeps turning her face
Cute sex game like our very first date
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
But oh! I know just where your hot spot at
You can not deny that, so do not try that
I do not buy that

You and me, having sex

After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, having sex, yeah
After an argument, that shit's the bestnrnMan, a nigga once told me like
You never know who your true friends until you ah um
Both got a little bit of money
I mean 'cause y'all both broke
Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

We used to get money together, bone honies together
Pushing chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
'Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is that?)
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

Look, I'm a grown man dog
And I ain't got time to be running behind y'all
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all
He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able
Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rapping
You showed your true colors, y'all niggas stay yapping
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum
Stop through the hood, to say what's happening? (sup nigga)
Fake hugs (uh-huh), fake whas up
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta warn myself for your fake shit, I raise up
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
About my bid'ness dog, y'all niggas stay up, one

We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushing chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
'Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

I wish, I wish, that success, we could all
Get a piece of it (word), but that ain't real dog (no)
'Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs
In the skirts with Jigga, and yelling out hey!
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors
But y'all niggas don't appreciate shit
Helped you out and you still acting like a little bitch
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row
When you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow

We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushing chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
'Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

A-Alike (uh-huh), be alike (that's right)
We don't vibe no more because we don't see alike
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the whole game
How he jeopardized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happening
But what I do know, all the niggas that you know
Locked up doing a few doe, but who knows?
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm bugging too (right)
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules

We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushing chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
'Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personalnrnDear God how can I explain myself?
Oh God bless me indeed
When I'm so confused
Enlarge my territory
Place your love and protection over me at all times
Uh, help me!
Keep me away from evil
Somebody answer me!
Allow me not to cause pain

Police in the background, screaming put the thing down
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down
Sirens ringing out, old ladies screaming out
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now
It's feeling like a dream now
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now
I'm lying next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggas back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold cold world but I overstand
Trying to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with being broke, I'm a man, c'mon

Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you going through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Late one night I was, rolling the streets
Just, thinking about what's going 'on with me and
Trapped in this thug life, trying to break free but
This thug life just keeps calling me
I'm living life way too dangerously
I'm drowning in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
'Cause poppa never was a part of me
Take one step at a time, mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, Don't you wish you was dead?
No ground to place my feet
I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need
Somebody, answer me!

Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you going through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
'Cause ain't no going home for me
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand
I drew first 'cause I knew that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma stepping foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt
Guess he's trying to do the same, told me get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
Momma's rent, his young brother's clothes
My nephew's food, and with that I sqooze
And with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles
And this story is told, for young soldiers
Who never choose the life we chose

Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you going through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Get the best of you

Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm trying to
Hold back my pride but reality is screaming
Gotta get a job 'cause momma also screaming
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiending
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause
Ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look
Neither God or my enemies, I
Choose God 'cause he understands, this
Young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swerving car, oh
No ground to place my feet (my feet)
I feel the fire under me (hey)
A way out is all I need (all I need)
Somebody, answer me!

Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you going through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Get the best of younrnWho the fuck can stop us niggas, it's gangsta niggas

Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll
If you wanna be down with me, you gotta roll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
You gotta know that I'm out chasing dough
I'm ain't stunting these hoes, stunting my growth
If I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them, I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you
I might roam like a cellular phone, but I never leave you alone, I
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
Pumping yay, since I was yay high
I'm in love with the life
So accept me for the bastard that I am
You're still in love with me right?

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey
But I can't stop hugging the block
All night tryna get this money
Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey
But I can't stop hugging the block
All night tryna get this money

Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out, man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
'Cause the game keeps calling me

Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my boys were shocked
They never thought that I'd pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain, got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear, I like her for her
I'm addicted to this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life, but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Locked down while his niggas is out (out)

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey
But I can't stop hugging the block
All night tryna get this money
Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey
But I can't stop hugging the block
All night tryna get this money

Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out, man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
'Cause the game keeps calling me

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey

Both found out, man, shit ain't pretty

What I'm gon' do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
'Cause the game keeps calling menrnPussy is a whole different aspect of life
Wars don' started from country to country, over their women
Pussy, is one of the most powerful things in the world
And a lot of people don't understand how powerful pussy is
Pussy make niggas, blow their brains out, their bitch brains out
Uh, uh, pussy make people do things they never would think they'd do

The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y (let's have some fun)
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get their hair cut, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y

I, I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the Snapper, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buying Gucci sandals, matching pocket books
Blowing up her beeper, ringing her phone off the hook
Ball players spent money, rappers they spent time
All the while they're both claiming that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
They ask her, Who pussy is this?, look her right in her eyes
She said This pussy's yours, daddy, tell 'em nothing but lies
Ha, they didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leaving you
So they ignored all her flirting ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get their hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

Now, I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfucking clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be giving mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why chumps be copping them diamonds and furs, and all that
Fiending for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysitting these broads need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought this girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creeping behind this nigga's back
He busted her, guess what, he still took the bitch back
Three things niggas love: money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft and in love
Y'all take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas, it's the lesbian R&amp;B thug

The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get their hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

The P is for the pearl tongue, that I like to tickle
The U is for the uterus, down deep in the middle
SS, it's so slippery, when I go up inside
Pussy is good, and if you getting some, I know you know why!
See, I got my first shot when I was about seven
Her father called my house and said:
I need to talk to your son, Devin
My daughter she's eleven
And she goes to the same school
That your son goes to, and she said today she got screwed!
But my daddy answered the phone, so no drama
And all he said was No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!
Then I was suspended three days, taken from school
It was like a vacation, nigga was looking at pussy at the pool in our apartments
I started hitting hard when I was small
Let me recite the story lesson for all of y'all
See pussy is like wound that would never heal
The more ointment you put on the better it feels, 'cause it's the

The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
Ha, the power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get their hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

Oh yeah, niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh
See it don't matter who you are
Where ya from, in this life
At some point, you're gonna wanna get you some
Yes you will, ooh, uhnrnIt was all a dream

Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racing through my head
Felt so real to me, this is what was said

Had a dream, I said; 'bout who? he said
'Bout B.I.G., I said; That's big, he said
Dig what he said. Proceed, he said
Indeed, I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say, I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
It came to me like a whisper last evening, I said
What's the deal, playboy? was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
'Mo' Money Mo' Problems'. Better believe it, he said
Careful what you wish for, you might receive it, he said
I see, I said, jealousy, I said
Got the whole industry mad at me, I said
Then B.I. said, Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!
I agree, I said, my one-of-a-kind self.
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before.
Just keep doing your thing, he said, say no more.

Was it all a dream, tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Was it all a dream, tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

I see, I said, jealousy, I said
Got the whole industry mad at me, I said
Then B.I. said, Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!
I agree, I said, my one-of-a-kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before.
Just keep doing your thing, he said; say no more.nrnYes, yes yep!
Welcome to the Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, he he
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some
Uh

Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)

Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standing on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant (the giant)
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they're trying to see
Further than I am (than I am)
And I have been trying to be patient with their preoccupation
With David and Goliath (Goliath)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run its course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant (be a tyrant)
But me and Tyran, coming through your environment
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back
With The Team no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyeing that
Y'all don't see clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
The Dynasty no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame, Kareem, nigga it's the gangster team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at getting cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
(Woo!) Jeah, jeah

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmovable, stop the unstoppable

Jeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift &amp; The Curse in one session
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flipping that raw
Flipping whores, flipping vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)

Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changing the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the making, Pistol Pete
Leave competition shaking without missing the beat (woo!)
Chasing the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, boom!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holding its breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you fooling?
You all are faggots, you taking us backwards (taking it backwards)
I'm trying to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
Who was gassing 'em? (Fuck outta here!)

Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)nrnThe Watcher!
Jeah, ugh
Shit I do for a living, nigga
Shit I eat for a living, nigga (The Watcher!)
That's how I live for a living, nigga
Watching
'Kay, let's do this
The Watcher!

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claiming they bangers
Doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespecting the game, no home training or manners
I was doing this shit when you was shitting in Pampers
I was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
Ducking the vans, radars and scanners
Before you knew what hard white or tan was
I was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands cause I'm hype with them hammers
I was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mil' laterxe2x80x94now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us coming through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
Grand, fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was putting Peter Pan up in your room
Y'all fucking with whom? Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learning the shit that we taught
You niggas ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high-speed Porsche
I.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'Til I came through the door like Eric B. for Prez
Respect me in this bitch!
You can't disrespect us 'cause you got a little check cut
You was sucking 'em so long, fucking your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
'Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I don't write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name!
J-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga, the future, proper
The Holy Trinity in hip-hop is us
We give Dre his props, but that's where it stops
It's the Roc!

I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top, had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters want a stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the man
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher

I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

I'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
It's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topicxe2x80x94the object? A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away to add a profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try coping
I seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scoping
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes openxe2x80x94The Watcher

I know
You got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try
But what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as before
People I used to know
Just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go
