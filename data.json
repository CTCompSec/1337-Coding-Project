{"contents":"I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up\nIn the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name\nI'm out here serving, disturbing the peace\nLife could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats\nHe's selling weight, I'm selling eight balls\nSixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all\nI ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me\nIf he give me the nod then these niggas going to see\nI'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day\nAnd chasing crackheads up the block for my pay\nI'm staying fresh, so chickens check\nI'm trying to step up to the next level\nPushing 'vettes through the 'jects\nDiamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibrium\nAnd stunned, I'm waiting for my day to come\nI got the urge to splurge\nI don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word"}
