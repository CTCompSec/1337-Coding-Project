"You couldn't son me if my father helped you\nMy punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you\nJa, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you\nEvery other week I'm buyin' a new pistol\nI clap at your ass with this chrome .38\nAnd put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's\nIrv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night\nI'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike\nYou know and I know who took your chain\nYou got robbed two times so your ass is lame\nI'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail\nYou better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch"
