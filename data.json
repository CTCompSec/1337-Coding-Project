"I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed\nThe way you're hacked and sliced\nWhen I fill your back with knives\nJackin' life's of MCs, now I'm set to launch a plan\nFor blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband\nI stomped your man, so unless you want what he got\nYou better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot\nI make the D hot, people get in my face and ask\nIf I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask\nIt's an amazin' task to battle with success\nI never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less\nAnd win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians\nInvisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions\nWicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you\nWhen I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra\nSo feel the force of my spiritual images\nSlicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages\nMy skin itches every time a rapper recites\nAnd when he's through with his verse\nI'm all covered in flea bites\nYou wanna see fights, I got a match for ya\nYou couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula"
