Roll with the winners\nHeavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella\nDon't get it corrected, this shit is perfected\nFrom chips to chicks to stripping a Lexus\nNaked without your gun, we taking everything you brung\nWe caking, you niggas is faking, we getting it done\nCrime family, well-connected, Jay-Z\nAnd you, fake thugs is unplugged like MTV\nI empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure\nDead presidentials, politics as usualxe2x80x94blaow!"
