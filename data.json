"Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze\nVictoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King\nThe price was like eight digits a long way, shit\nGot the beachfront view, V1 too\nCop you one, cop me one too\nOn the place, jet ski's park by the lake\nNo neighbors, make all the noise you want to make\nInvite your friends over\nLet 'em make their way through the Benzes and the Rovers\nBefore they reach the door\nVacate, away a week or more\nFirst class to and fro, freaking off\nGot to have things locked, champagne popped\nCruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop\nCop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot\nCan't complain, we balling, true or not ma?"
