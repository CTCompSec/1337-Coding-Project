"You got nothing to offer\nBut the baby nine\nAnd make ya fine offer\nThe chick is ill\nEven with four-inch heels\nNo panties on and Patricia Fields\nI get down\nJust name the time, the place\nWe could take it back to Vaseline on our face\nOn a regular day we just gleam up your space\nRock our own line, got our whole team laced\nRW with the torch on my jeans by the waist\nWithout heat we still gon' steam up the place\n(Amil-lion, Jigga man, flawless, here we go)"
