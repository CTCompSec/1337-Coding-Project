"Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play\nWe're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier\nBaby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea\nMama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)\nThat's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry\nDada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake\nHere, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)\nWe'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock\nReady now, here we go, on the count of free\nOne, two, free, whee (whoosh)\nThere goes Mama, splashin' in the water\nNo more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order\nNo more step-dada, no more new brother\nBlow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)\nNow we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk\nBut first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk"
