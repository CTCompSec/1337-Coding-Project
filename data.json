"You know what I'm saying?\nI'm tired of all of this bullshit\nTelling me to be positive\nHow'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI rap about shit around me, shit I see\nKnow what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything\nTired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city\nCan't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?\nBut hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?\nJust fed up\nThat's my Word"
