"My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling\nBlitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England\nI'm out the game, put the second string in\nThis Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)\nDelinquent, choking microphones with broken English\nMake your mama be like Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?\nSlim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it\nIt's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit\nIt was predicted by a medic, I'd grow\nTo be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic\nPathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing\nPanicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin\nFrozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue\nI think I'm dying, God is that you?\nSomebody help me, before I OD on an LP\nTake me to ER ASAP for an IV\nMotherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop\nThey say that's where it lives\nThe closest they gon' come is 2Pac\nIt's politics, it's all a fix\nSet up for these white blue-collared hicks\nIt's to make a dollar off of black music\nWith a subliminal ball of tricks\nFor those who kiss ass and swallow dicks"
