"You can catch me\nSkating through your town, putting it down, y'all relating\nNo waiting, I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan\nY'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to\nHustle behind the wheel, trying to escape my trouble\nKids stop they're greeting me, I'm talking sweet to keys\nCursing the very God that brought this grief to be\nMy life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis\nAnd fools that think I slip, you fuck around\nYou get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy\nOn some I-do-or-die shit, for real\nThe price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and\nJust think, winter's here, I'm trying to feel mink, nigga"
