"C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach\nGrab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat\nOh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk\nOh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk\nNow, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'\nBut you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women\nThat do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit\nDon't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)\nAnd don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?\nDon't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)\nAnd Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float\nAnd don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat\nIt's just a little scratch, it don't hurt\nHer was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'\nAnd spilled ketchup on her shirt\nMama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water\nAnd me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?"
