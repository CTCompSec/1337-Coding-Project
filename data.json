"I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you\nAnd cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue\nI'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles\nAnd pull you apart from both angles\nI wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins\nAnd bust open like broken water mains\nSo tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb\n'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm\nGot your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm\nSo big my entire arm is a giant firebomb\nBuy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on\nAnd the pants to match (Here, Momma, try 'em on)\nI get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives\nA brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives\n(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents\nGod help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again"
