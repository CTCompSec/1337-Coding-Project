"Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined\nThe Maniac's in in place of the doctor\n'Cause Dre couldn't make it today\nHe's a little under the weather\nSo I'm taking his place"
 bitch's head off\nWait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?\nWhat, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?\nTsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\nOkay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?\nGrab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?\nWhat you say?\nWhat's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?\nI'ma kill you, motherfucker\nUh-uh, temper, temper\nMr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A., Mr. AK\nComin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way\nHow in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that\nAw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?\nShoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?"
