"Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful\nLeave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled\nI'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue\nWant some gum? Put down the scissors\n'Fore you do something dumb\nI'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?\nI gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these\n(I'ma kill him)\nJohn, where's Dave at? Before I bash you\nHe's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude\nDave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance\nThere's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off\nAnd there's only two days left of Spring Break\nHow long do these things take to wear off?\nWell, it depends on how many you had\nI took three, she ate the other 22 caps\nNow she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol\nShe's gonna die, dude\nI know and it's my fault\nOh my God"
