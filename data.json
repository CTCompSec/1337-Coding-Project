"Relax yourself, let your conscience be free\nYou now rolling with them thugs from the R-O-C\nAin't no place on the planet that you'd rather be\nBut in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game\nCross over to the Roc, make yourself hot\nThe topic of discussion in every nail shop\nIt's a secret society, all we ask is trust\nAnd within a week, watch your arm freeze up\nBrassiere get right, A to a D cup\nWeave get tight, pedicure your feet up\nEars get iced, gear get spiced\nFrom hood rat to superstar, there's your life\nFuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell\nSay bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel\nSay hi to Gucci, Prada as well\nTake a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself"
