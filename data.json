"You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me\nYou wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me\nIntellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier\nInferior, deterior rate, like bacteria\nMaterially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see\nHow much in fear when you hear me you'll be\nShiver and shake, quiver and quake\nBite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache\nWither and break, you slitherin' snake\nGibberin' fake, fibber and flake\nI'll twist you in a different shape\nAnd toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake\nIf this is a dream, you wish you can wake\nEvery diss you can take, personal\nWe ain't friends tryna make amends\nIf you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense\nI make intense masterpieces\nAnd smash to pieces your last releases\nYou pass diseases, that's the reason\nI'm showin' you the proper way to\nOperate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato\nI've never been less than clever and fresh\nSeverin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest"
