"God in my cell, that's my celly\nMade in the image of God, that′s a selfie\nPray five times a day, so many felonies\nWho gon' post my bail? Lord, help me\nHol' up, Donda, I′m with your baby when I touch back road\nTold him, \"Stop all of that red cap, we goin′ home\"\nNot me with all of these sins, casting stones\nThis might be the return of The Throne (Throne)"
