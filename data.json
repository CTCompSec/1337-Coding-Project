"I'm from the M-to-the-A-baby-R-C-Y\nSo it's hard for me to let the larceny die\nNiggas see me in the streets with no bodyguards\nJust two big guns that'll body your squad\n'Cause niggas be scheming on me, probably are\nThink Jigga's a joke, nigga? Hardy har\nI spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust\nRadio's gotta play me though I cuss too much\nMagazines say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim\nStill they put me on their cover 'cause I earn for them\nSoon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him\n'Cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them\nI spit that murder-murder-murderous every time a verbalist\nIller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in Menace\nI'm ill, start to finish, I rip apart contenders\nI'm hot hehehehe"
