"Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless\nBut if you shoot me, then you're famous, what's a nigga to do?\nWhen the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking\nWaiting for you to break, make your first mistake\nCan't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted\nBut my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it\nBeef assorted like Godiva chocolates\nNiggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it\nPlan aborted, you and your mans get a pass\nThis rhyme, you're operating on bitch time\nY'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas tryna do\nIs hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneilly\nThe type to start a beef then run to the cops\nWhen I see you in the street got one in the drop\nWhen I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop\nTaking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop\nThe streets is watching"
