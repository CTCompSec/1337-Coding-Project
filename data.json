"I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor\nTired of taking pop bottles back to the party store\nI'm tired of not having a phone\nTired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on\nTired of not driving a BM\nTired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him\nTired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM\nTired of not performing in a packed coliseum\nTired of not being on tour\nTired of fucking the same blonde whore\nAfter work in the back of a Contour\nI'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones\nHaving a lack of funds and resorting back to guns\nTired of being stared at\nTired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat\nTired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz\nTired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs\nTired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me\nSaying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me\nAnd I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs\nTired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives"
