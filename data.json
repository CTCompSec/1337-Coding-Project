"I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move\nYou're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage\nGotta love it 'cause I expose the faxc3xa7ade\nYour little lungs is too small to hotbox with God\nAll jokes aside, come bounce with us\nStandin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust\nIt's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust\nI might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs\nSo who do you trust? They just not rugged enough\nWhen things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff\nBitch, please! You must have a mental disease\nAssume the position and get back down on your knees\nCome on"
