"Woo! Who you loving, who you wanna be hugging? Heh\nWho you with, who you wanna be fucking?\nGot this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question\nI read a couple books to add to her soul's progression\nTo put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge\nShe gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college\nNow all she does is homework, I give her in house tutoring\nIn and out I'm moving through her student body union\nAnd she, call me Professor, say daddy come and test her\nSo she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester\nI'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate\nShe said, I ain't no fool I'll make it up in summer school"
