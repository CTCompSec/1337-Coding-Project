"Don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas\nIn the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas\nI did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas\nI've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa\nSkated through with the Caesar picadas\nAt high school got head by the lockers\nGassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers\nRocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail\nRhymes still written well, hold court in the street\nNever sit in the cell for a second then I'm getting my bail\nShoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck\nSitting in the county for summers if they should down me\nEverybody around us become one for that day\nTo live life get your shit right and play\nDon't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's OK\nBut life's short, don't miss a day, uh"
