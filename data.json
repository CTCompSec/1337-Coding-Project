"It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit\nWe say we do it for our baby but we don't\nWe do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one\nOf us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust\nAnd we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout\n'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house\nI throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth\nFist fight 'til we turn this mother out\nThen apologize after, laughter, pain\nIt's insane, we're back in the same chapter again\nAnd it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you\nThere ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause"
