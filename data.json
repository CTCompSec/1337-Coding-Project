"Everything in my power and within my frame\nTo protect you from this life and keep you away from the game\nBut you was one of the few people that I can trust\nAnd the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us\nYou put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go\nWas a thousand and one times I had to tell you no\nBut it was one of those days when nobody was around\nAnd I needed emergency trip out of town\nSearched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know\nAs you stared in my face asking me could you go\nI agreed said send her everything'll go smooth\nJust tell her what to do and everything'll go through\nStrapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane\nCouldn't explain the strange feeling that I caught in the vein\nI'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right\nI'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life\nYou must've love me"
