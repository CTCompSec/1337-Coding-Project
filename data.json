"Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em\nChicks dream on him, trick cream on 'em\nLose it when dudes think it's just music\nLean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em\nSexin' around the way girls down to miras\nI'm something every girl gotta have like Levi's\nChiquita, mi amor, see how raw\nYou can love me or hate me, either or\nI'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys\nNever eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Pennys\nCan he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave\nJust as quick, Indian give, ha-hah\nNow what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap\nLike she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that\nYou be the same chick when you leave me\nThe bankbook and the credit cards\nAnd take everything you came with (it's on)"
