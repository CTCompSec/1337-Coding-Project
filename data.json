"Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong\nBleek is too hot, Beans is gone\nY'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all)\nY'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)\nThe whole Roc is jumping, we reached our zenith\nGot fiends throwing up on them self like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)\nAny given Sunday gunplay's optional\nHowever niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you want it?)\nWhoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole\nDikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit\nPlus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick\nLeft hand'll lean 'em like a little past six\nNow run along with your little-ass hits\nRead my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!\nShut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers\nAll you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk\nWhen I blast the pump\nI leave you relaxed in the hospital, looking at M*A*S*H for months\nThen I dumps dough on the D.A. desk\nAnd I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps\nWe've got no respect, no law or governing\nWhy you fucking with him?\nMatter fact, why you fucking with them?\nAll y'all need is the R-O-C, baby"
