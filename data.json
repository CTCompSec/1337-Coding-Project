"I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone\nI'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone\nI'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason\nI'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'\nFlavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview\nI'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review\nI'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals\nThis is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols\nBut I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles\nSlim Shady, M&amp;M was the old initials (Bye-bye)\nExtortion, snortin', supportin' abortion\nPathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion\nThe looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic\nImpulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict\nHalf animal, half man\nDumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can\nWith more holes than an afghan"
