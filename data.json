"The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things\nAll this after a week in the bing\nI'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling\nI would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing\nNigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke\nEven pricked our finger, anything that got between us\nWe supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?\nInstead you copped out to a misdemeanor\nFuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)\nThe same game that make you math could make you die\n(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap\nWho would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?\nNow you know that's bad when your sister is mad\nAnd your son gotta grow up, like, This is my dad?\nThe labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar\nYou'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars"
