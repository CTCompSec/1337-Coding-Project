"Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)\nI'm a caged demon\nOn stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine\nI'm convinced I'm a fiend\nShootin' up while this record is spinnin'\nClinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion\nFuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure\nI'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher\nI can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches\nSick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes\nIn school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush\nDoin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush\nThen I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed\nWent to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team\nDon't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian\nToo many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again\nI'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median\nFinally made it home but I don't got the key to get in"
