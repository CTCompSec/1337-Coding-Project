"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired\nYo, left, yo, left\nFeel weak and when you feel weak\nYo, left, right, left\nYou feel like you wanna just give up\nYo, left, yo left\nBut you gotta search within you\nYo, left, right, left\nTry to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you\nYo, left, yo left\nAnd get that motivation to not give up\nYo, left, right, left\nAnd not be a quitter, no matter how bad\nYo, left, yo left\nYou wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse\nYo, left, right, left"
