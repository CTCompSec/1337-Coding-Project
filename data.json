{"contents":"So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)\nI couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun\nThrough customs over in London\nAnd last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie\nWhere he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi\nI see these three little kids up in the front row\nScreaming, Go! with their seventeen-year-old uncle\nI'm like, guidance?!\nAin't they got the same moms and dads\nWho got mad when I asked if they liked violence?\nAnd told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?\nWhat about the make-up\nYou allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)\nSo tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words\nWhen his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse\n(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)\nAnd fuck was the first word I ever learned\nUp in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)\nSo read up 'bout how I used to get beat up\nPeed on, be on free lunch\nAnd changed school every three months\nMy life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)\nFucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike\nSo how much easier would life be\nIf nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?"}
