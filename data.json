"I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter\nSometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike\nJust to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke\nAnd steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard\nAnd drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark\nTo meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark\nTo sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's\nThat's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps\nAt Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows\nAt Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime\nHe looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, White boys don't know how to rhyme.\nI spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place\nAnd we both had the same rhymes that sound alike\nWe was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined\nFrom that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line"
