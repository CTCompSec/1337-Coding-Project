"Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke\nGet my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite\nStill on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason\nShould be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'\nLast week this old man I had to blast\n'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas\nRipped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook\nDidn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook\nFuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack\nBetter explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at\nI done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should\nThis wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good\nRob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route\nThrowin' bombs at day care centers and yell, Everybody get out!\nMy girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece\n'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair\nWith her 10-year-old niece"
