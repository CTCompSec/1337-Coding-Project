"I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter\nBut I thought a song would probably be a little better\nInstead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah\nI stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of\nHow much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of\nPaper, I'd rather let you see how\nMuch I fucking hate you in a freestyle\nYou're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die, ho\nI hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye\nI hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Die)\nBut please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad\nIt's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back\nIt's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (Ack)\nWhat else can I do? I haven't got a clue\nNow I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to\nBut every time I think of you now all I wanna do is puke"
