"There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)\nBut it's the evil that made me\nThis backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)\nI want the money, the women, the fortune and fame\nThat means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame\nThat means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name\nThis lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\n'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom\nI've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)\nI'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em\nHoldin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em\nAnd them rings you're wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em\nAnd while you flaunt 'em\nI could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em\nI got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?\n'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song\nI'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn"
ms and foreign tools\nThis is for every time you took my orange juice\nOr stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk\nEvery time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt\nI'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good\nI cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could\nAnd beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood\nKnocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot\nMade it home later that same day\nStarted readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray\nI couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read\nI went deaf and my left ear started to bleed\nMy mother started screamin', What are you on, drugs?!\nLook at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug (I'm sorry)\nShe beat me over the head with the remote control\nOpened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull\nI picked it up and screamed, Look, bitch, what have you done?\nOh my God, I'm sorry, son\nShut up, you cunt\nI said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head\nThen I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck"
