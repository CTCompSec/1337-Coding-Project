"When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?\nTurned out to be more than just a fling, huh?\nThree hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?\nWho you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?\nYou know you'll always be my favorite prom queen\nEven when we in dad shoes, or mom jeans\nToo many complaints made it hard for me to think\nWould you shut up? I canâ€²t hear myself drink"
