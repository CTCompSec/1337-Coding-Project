"I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters\nWho swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns\nOutsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts\n'Cause we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source\nYo, they never should've booted me out of reform school (Uh-uh)\nDeformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool\n'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn\nI said, It wasn't me, I got a twin\nOh my God, it's you, not again (Ah)\nIt all started when my mother took my bike away\n'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave\nAfter that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers\nSlappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors\nClass clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman\nFuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'\nAnd all the other kids said, Eminem is a thizz head\nHe'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed\nMaybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class\nThat she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast\n(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big\nYou walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig\n(Well, I have never)\nShe picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig\nPut me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig\n(Wait, wait, wait, wait)\nI felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)\nIt began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'\nGrabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)\nAnd took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down\nSorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop\nWhile I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop"
