"Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us\nMoshpits outside the Oval Office\nSomeone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just\nSayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward\nThat we have empowered, this is Bin Laden\nLook at his head noddin'\nHow could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?\nNow this is our final hour\nLet me be the voice and your strength and your choice\nLet me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise\nTry to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six\n'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch\nMaybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech\nLet the president answer a higher anarchy\nStrap him with an AK-47, let him go\nFight his own war, let him impress daddy that way\nNo more blood for oil\nWe got our own battles to fight on our own soil\nNo more psychological warfare\nTo trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal\nIf we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero\nLook in his eyes, it's all lies\nThe stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped\nAnd replaced with his own face, mosh now or die\nIf I get sniped tonight, you'll know why\n'Cause I told you to fight"
