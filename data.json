"[Kuniva:]\nWe stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell\n'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales\nReckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace\nGruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums\nI grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle\nRun right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you\nGet executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth\nAnd it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it\nI love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers\nShoot up the household, even the young toddlers\nBrigade barricade to bring the noise\nWhile the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys\nIf I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo\nA big Chinese nigga screamin', Kuniva, yo, yo!\nI leave ya face leakin', run up in church\nAnd smack the preacher while he's preachin'\nTake a swing at the deacon"
