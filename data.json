"I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should\n'Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood\nAll black in the club, the outcome ain't good\nThem niggas act like wolves, how come? They could\n'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash\n'Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass\nThe necklace chipped up, the charm it flash\nCould fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash\nSee the reason why chicks let me palm their ass\nAll I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn they're glad\nLet me sit up in the whip 'til I launch it back\nSnap their neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back\nThe calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat\nKill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back\nMonster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that\nAnd everybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon\nUh-huh uh uh"
