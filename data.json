"Ayy, all of my n-as on Channel 5\nI don′t channel ten 'til it go time\nUsed to throw up my uncle′s spaghetti\nBeen toting totes since before I was ready\nBack when my mama told me that I was challenged\nA single black woman, you know that she petty\nI turned a heavy heart to two million dollars\nI put that in totals, reverse out the day"
