"Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't wanna look\nAt nothin', this world's too much\nI've swallowed all I could\nIf I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good\nJust say goodbye to Hollywood\nI probably should, these problems are piling all at once\n'Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up\nI think I'm bottomin' out\nBut I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up\nThank God, I got a little girl\nAnd I'm a responsible father\nSo not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud\nMust be in my blood 'cause I don't know how I do it\nAll I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps of my dad\n'Cause I hate him so bad\nThe worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man\nIf you could understand why I am the way that I am\nWhat do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em I'm"
