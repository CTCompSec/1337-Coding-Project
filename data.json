"Mama, you was the life of the party\nI swear you brought life to the party\nWhen you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)\nThat woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)\nVisions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me\nMovin' to the hood was like signin′ up for the army\n'Cause they been killin′ n- since n- was watchin' Barney (Jesus)\nYou want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)\n′Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here"
