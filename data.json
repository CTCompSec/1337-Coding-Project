"This shit is wicked on these mean streets\nNone of my friends speak, we're all tryna win\nBut then again, maybe it's for the best though\n'Cause when they're saying too much\nYou know they're tryna get you touched\nWhoever said illegal was the easy way out\nCouldn't understand the mechanics\nAnd the workings of the underworld, granted\nNine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive\nI'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot\nLife ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills\nI never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti\nThat's right, it's wicked, that's life, I live it\nAin't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends\nI break bread with the late heads\nPicking their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do\nIt gets dangerous, money and power is changing us\nAnd now we're lethal, infected with D'evils"
