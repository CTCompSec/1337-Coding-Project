"I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net\nPoppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck\nI deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check\nI'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\nFull of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged\nAnd my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper\nI pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer\nWatchin' ballers while they're flossin' in they Pathfinders\nThese overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\nAlong with the small fries and average half-pinters\nBut player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas\n'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us\nMoney'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless\nThem snakes slither in the grass, spineless"
