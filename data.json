"I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you\nThings you joke about with your friends inside your living room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it\nIn front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums\nIt's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting\nPinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working\nAnd every single person is a Slim Shady lurking\nHe could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings\n[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling\nScreaming I don't give a fuck!\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo, will the real Shady please stand up?\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up?\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?"
