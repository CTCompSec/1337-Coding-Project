"You not understand, I am not your mans\nSee, I′m super, I got plans, trips across the land\nDiamonds dancin' on my hands, Cudder in demand\nAll in pink like Killa′ Cam, holy\nWatch 'em go, baby like what she see, hey\nIn the evening, it′s the time, and it's right, hey\nTakin′ it solo, lose the bag, it's disco, hey\nJust a doin' damage plus some damage, you know, it′s a thing\nAnd we ridin′, it's a little bit of liquor and we slidin′, it's on\nAnd we ′bout it, say goodbye to the worries, baby, so long\nFeelin' she love my shine, oh\nColor outside the lines, I am so out of control\nAnd I′m fallin', glowin' in the mold\nAnd she said she understands the code, see, we play our roles\nThis is how it goes, innocent, ooh\nAnd I′m tryna find you in my dreams, ooh\nSee, I′m just a creature in the night, she gives me what I like\nElectric through my bones, feels so right"
