"Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best\nI ain't got it to give, but I got it to test\nAnd if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest\nIs your time, I gotta move this in a week or less\nFor the next couple of days I brought out all I possess\nThe Rolex, necklaces with the VVS\nBetween the driver and the passenger where the TV rest\nFor my top draft picks I cop the new GS\nNow all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team\nCause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream\nPicked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things\nYou know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens\nYo, never lay your head where you holding them things\nKeep the family then your business, nothing goes in between\nNever feared no man, put four in his bean\nDrop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?"
