"Yo, yo, well I'm gold now\nMemph Man, Coming of Age and I'm grown now\nSitting on chrome now\nI'm the youngest gun, I get it on with anyone\nI've been in 30 beefs shit I'm barely 21\nGuns I hold 'em like offensive linemen\nBring 'em back to the streets like a brick on consignment\nInterlining of the Mark Buchanan\nSpark two hammers\nMemph Man gold marks the understanding"
