"You feel my triumph never, feel my pain\nI'm lying low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came\nThe game changes like my mind just ain't right\nRewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night\nSucking me in like a vacuum, I remember\nTelling my family, I'll be back soon. That was December\n'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later\nGot me wise still can't break my underworld ties\nI wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot\nGot matching VCRs, a huge Magnavox\nTen inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage\nIt's a lot of big money in my sentence\nHitting towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that\nCheck baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that\nAin't no stopping the champagne from popping\nThe drawers from dropping, the law from watching, I hate 'em"
