Man, how's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?\nI'mma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat\nAnyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan\nThis is Stan"}
