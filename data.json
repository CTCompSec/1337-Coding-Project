"I live life in the fast lane\nMan I ain't got nothing to lose, everything to gain\nEither you with me or against me man ain't nothing change\nNigga, you, go against the grain, I'll make you, walk with a cane\nNow nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same\nNigga nobody hears your name, you got down with a gang\nO thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang\nYou got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang\nY'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich\nThey ain't even got to talk to take your bitch\nOne look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o\nShe seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes\nAyo the bitch used to bring you dough, used to be your bottom ho\nNow your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go\nRoll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers\nPolitic with the willies the real shot callers"
